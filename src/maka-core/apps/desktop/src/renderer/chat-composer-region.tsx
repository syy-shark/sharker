 * AppShell renders this as a stable sibling of the section switch, so it is

 * and draft across section switches and permission takeovers (#646 draft
 * preservation, permission-composer-takeover contract). `hidden` drives the
 * native hidden state instead of unmounting.

 * Composer props are forwarded via ComponentProps spread; `hidden`,

 * so AppShell only forwards the orchestration callbacks and the session maps.
