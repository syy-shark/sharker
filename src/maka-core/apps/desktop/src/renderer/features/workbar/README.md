# Workbar feature

Workbar is a vertical renderer feature. Its application-level model owns the
right/bottom panel topology, active tabs, dimensions and persisted collapse
state. Tool data remains session-scoped, and the session content surface is
remounted when the active session changes.

## Dependency direction

- Consumers import production APIs from `features/workbar`.
- Node test suites may additionally import `features/workbar/testing`.
- Storybook may additionally import `features/workbar/stories`, which exposes
  `WorkbarSurface`. It stays out of the production entry because `workbar-host`
  reaches the surface through `lazy()`, and out of `testing` because that entry
  is loaded by `node --test` against tsc output while the surface and its tool
  panels use extensionless relative specifiers only a bundler resolves.
- Workbar may use shared renderer primitives, core types and Maka UI.
- Workbar must not import shell composition, Desktop bridge, or main-process implementation.
- Desktop I/O enters through `WorkbarServices`; tool code does not read
  the Desktop global bridge directly.
- `useWorkbarController` is the application boundary for topology, shortcuts,
  dynamic resources and Side Chat visibility. `AppShell` supplies only the
  active Session, workspace availability, authoritative Session ids, shell visibility and composer
  mention/model context.

## Public surface

- `host` is passed intact to `<WorkbarHost model={workbar.host} />`.
- `commands.openTool`, `commands.openSideChatWithQuote` and
  `commands.toggleRight` are the only shell actions.
- `selectors.rightCollapsed` drives the titlebar restore affordance and
  `selectors.rightExpanded` fills the conversation column (fullscreen workbar).
  `selectors.hiddenSessionIds` filters ephemeral companion forks from the rail.
- The new-task composer (no Session yet) still hosts the right workbar under
  `NEW_TASK_WORKBAR_SESSION_ID`, and opening that surface reveals the column.

## Lifecycle invariants

- Review, Tasks, Browser, Files and Inspector tabs are persisted globally.
- Terminal and Side Chat tabs, preview state and resource metadata are
  transient.
- `WORKBAR_TOOL_DEFINITIONS` is the authority for persistence, singleton
  behavior and default placement; storage and controller code consume it
  rather than maintaining parallel kind lists.
- Closing or leaving the owner session stops Terminal resources.
- A Terminal start is tagged with its source generation. If it resolves after
  a Session switch or controller disposal, the returned resource is stopped
  immediately and never enters the tab topology.
- Terminal ownership is registered as soon as `start` returns, before the tab
  state commits. Host projection excludes resources owned by another Session,
  so a Session switch cannot briefly reattach an old Terminal.
- Side Chat survives panel collapse and is cleaned only when its tab closes or
  when navigation leaves its source session.
- Disposed Side Chat operations are fenced at every fork/send boundary; a late
  fork is cleaned and a late send cannot write back into an abandoned panel.
- Inactive tabs stay mounted; their hooks receive the existing active/hidden
  signal and decide whether to subscribe.
- Inspector keeps two authorities separate: Session events refresh its paged
  timeline/context window, while usage-change events refresh the complete
  Session usage summary. Re-activation and head refresh preserve the requested
  trace page depth.

## Adding a tool

Add its metadata, define the smallest service port it needs, implement its hook
and surface under `tools/`, register fake-service story states, and pin both its
state transitions and resource cleanup in tests.
