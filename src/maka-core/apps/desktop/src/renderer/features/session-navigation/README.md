# Session Navigation feature

Session Navigation is the renderer feature boundary for the Session rail. It
owns:

- rail membership, linked-session highlighting, Project/Runtime Host grouping,
  worktree badges, branch banners, and revision navigation;
- collapsed/expanded state, width, grouping mode, and their existing local
  persistence keys;
- explicit jumps into a Session, including search turn targets; and
- flag, archive, restore, rename, delete, and archived-task purge lifecycles.

## Dependency direction

- Consumers import production APIs from `features/session-navigation`.
- Tests may additionally import `features/session-navigation/testing`.
- Desktop Sessions bridge calls go through `SessionNavigationServices`; only
  `platform/desktop/create-session-navigation-services.ts` reads that bridge.
- Session Navigation may use shared renderer storage/copy, core types, and Maka
  UI, but must not import AppShell, preload implementation, or main-process
  code.

AppShell remains responsible for the authoritative catalog snapshot and for
composing explicit cross-feature intents: top-level destination selection,
WorkHub exit, active-Session selection, transcript clearing, and renderer-state
cleanup. Session Navigation does not own catalog authority, transcript/runtime
state, Session controls, task submission, or Module Hub routing.

Those intents stay intents. Opening a Session also clears the active transcript
and leaves WorkHub, and the rail does not subscribe to either: it calls them
through `SessionNavigationPorts`, which the shell composes.

## Public surface

- `<SessionNavigationProvider>` is where the rail's state lives. It calls
  `useSessionNavigationController` and publishes what the rail reads as two
  contexts — its data and its chrome — so a re-render of AppShell is not a
  re-render of the rail (#4109).
- `useSessionNavigationController` owns layout, projections, and row mutation
  commands. It is called by the provider and nowhere else; calling it in a
  render body above the rail is what put the rail's state on the whole tree.
- `useSessionNavigationReads` is the shell's own narrow read: the rail
  projection it also needs for the command palette, the branch banner, the
  revision navigation, and the rail's width. It holds no state.
- `createSessionOpenCommand` composes an explicit Session jump out of the
  shell's own actions.
- `sessionRailLayoutStore` owns collapse, width, and grouping mode, with the
  existing persistence keys.

## Lifecycle invariants

- Archived, linked-subagent, and hidden companion Sessions follow the existing
  single-rail projection; a linked child highlights its visible root.
- Local Sessions group by Project while remote Sessions group by Runtime Host.
- Opening a Session first exits WorkHub, selects the Sessions destination, then
  activates the Session and replaces or clears the turn-scroll target.
- At most one row mutation runs per Session. Mutations retain revision-family
  semantics, and renderer state is cleared only after the Host confirms removal.
- Width persistence remains trailing-debounced; width, collapse, and grouping
  reuse the existing local-storage keys and hydration rules.
