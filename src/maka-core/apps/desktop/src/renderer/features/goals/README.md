# Goals feature

Goals is a vertical renderer feature. It owns the active Goal read model,
Goal-change subscription, arm/pause/resume/clear controls, dialog target, and
the Goal indicator projection consumed by the chat surface.

## Dependency direction

- Consumers import production APIs from `features/goals`.
- Tests and stories may additionally import `features/goals/testing`.
- Goals may use shared renderer copy, core types, and Maka UI.
- Goals must not import `AppShell`, the preload implementation, or the main process.
- Desktop I/O enters through `GoalServices`; feature code never reads the
  Desktop global bridge directly.
- `AppShell` supplies the active Session id and a session-scoped error reporter.
  It consumes only `<GoalHost>`, commands, and selectors.

## Lifecycle invariants

- A Goal is session-scoped. Switching Sessions clears the previous read model
  synchronously and fences late reads before fetching the new Goal.
- Only `active`, `waiting`, and well-formed `paused` Goals are projected. A
  settled Goal removes the indicator and composer active state.
- Goal-change broadcasts refresh the active Session; events for another
  Session do not.
- Pause and resume are mutually exclusive per Session while a control request
  is pending, preserving the existing re-entry guard.
- Opening the dialog snapshots the active Session id. Navigating while it is
  open cannot retarget the arm request to a different Session.
- A reconnecting arm result closes only when the Host confirms a new Goal.
  Reconciled or unavailable results lock the form and show the authoritative
  outcome, preventing an accidental duplicate arm request.
- Form input and errors reset on each open. Budgets are validated against core
  bounds and are never silently clamped.

## Public surface

- `host` is passed intact to `<GoalHost model={goals.host} />`.
- `commands.openDialog` is the shell entry for the composer action.
- `selectors.active` disables duplicate Goal creation and
  `selectors.indicator` feeds the active chat surface.

The Desktop adapter is created once in the renderer composition root. Tests
use `createFakeGoalServices` from `testing.ts`; production code must not import
that entry.
