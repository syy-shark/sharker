/**
 * The desktop's read model for the active session's execution boundary — the
 * one place that decides when the renderer's copy of the boundary is stale.
 *
 * The boundary is main-process authority, so an Effect synchronising with it is
 * the right tool; what this hook must never become is a mirror of renderer
 * state. It therefore keeps exactly one fact (the last settled read from main)
 * and re-reads on the two events that can change it: the active session
 * changing, and a caller reporting that a boundary decision settled (#1611).
 *
 * Before #1611 the surface displayed every managed boundary as Auto, so a stale
 * snapshot was invisible. Now that the label reports what the session may
 * actually do, staleness would be an active false statement about permissions:
 * a read-only session that has just been granted write access would keep
 * showing "read only". Approving an expansion only bumps the boundary's
 * revision — no session field changes — so nothing else here can notice it.
 *
 * #1629: a failed read used to be swallowed, leaving the snapshot unset for
 * good. Nothing here re-fires on its own, so the surface fell closed
 * permanently and the composer never came back. A failed read is now retried on
 * a bounded schedule and, when that runs out, reported as `unreadable` so the
 * surface can say so and offer another attempt. Every read runs as a generation
 * that only commits while it is still the current one — see
 * `startActiveExecutionBoundaryRead` for why a late reply is the same bug.
