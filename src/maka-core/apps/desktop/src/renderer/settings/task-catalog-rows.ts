/**
 * The archived tasks, counted the way the rail counts tasks.
 *
 * `sessions.list()` returns the physical session catalog, which is not the set
 * of things a person calls a task: edit-and-resend produces one session per
 * revision, and a linked subagent session belongs to the task that spawned it.
 * `deriveSessionRail` already owns both rules — including the one that is easy
 * to get wrong on a second pass, that a linked child whose parent is gone stays
 * a row of its own instead of vanishing from every surface at once. Reusing it
 * is what makes a row here mean what a row there means; a second projection
 * would only mean it approximately.
 *
 * No active session is passed. The rail passes one so it can highlight the row
 * you are on, but that also pins a family's representative to whichever
 * revision happens to be open — which would move a row's name, date and
 * position here for a reason this page never shows. The rail additionally hides
 * in-flight companion forks, another property of its own view rather than of
 * the archived catalog.
