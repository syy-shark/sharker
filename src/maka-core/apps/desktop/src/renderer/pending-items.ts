/** Generic keyed staging registry shared by composer surfaces. */
export type PendingByKey<T> = Record<string, T[]>;

/**
 * The bucket the session-less composer stages into, whatever the workspace
 * picker points at (#3408).
 *
 * The rest of the new-task surface is keyed by (profileId, hostId, projectId)
 * since #3122, and staged files and quotes were keyed with it. But they are
 * in-memory intent, not Host state: nothing persists them, and nothing restores
 * them per target. Keying them by the target only made them drop out of the
 * composer when the picker moved.
 *
 * A key that never moves is also the only owner an in-flight submission can
 * safely have. `send()` captures the key it submitted from and clears that key
 * when it resolves, so a key that followed the picker would leave the files it
 * just sent staged under the new target, ready to be sent a second time. This
 * one cannot go stale, so no re-keying rule is needed to keep it honest.
