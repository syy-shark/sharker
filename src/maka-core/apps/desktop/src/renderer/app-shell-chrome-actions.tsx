 * across the tree by a `handleRef` so a click reached SideNav's internal
 * collapse state, which called `onCollapsedChange`, which set the shell state
 * that was already being passed back down as `isCollapsed`. Three hops to a
 * setter the shell holds directly — and none of the component's own outputs
 * survived: the shell overrode its label and its icon, its `isCollapsible`
 * check could not fail (the ref reads `null` on first render and falls back to
 * `true`), and its mobile branch is unreachable behind `breakpoint: 'none'`.
 * What is left after removing all of that is this button, which is also exactly
 * what the workbar's toggle already was.

/**
 * The titlebar's right edge.
 *
 * It used to also carry a `…` menu holding 问题反馈 / 打开命令面板 / 打开帮助 /
 * 打开健康中心 — a drawer of four things that each belong somewhere else.
 * 健康中心 was a duplicate of the Settings nav entry, 问题反馈 only opened
 * Settings → 关于, and the other two now have real homes: the keyboard sheet is
 * a row on 关于, and the palette keeps ⌘K, which that sheet documents.
 *
 * What is left is the collapsed workbar's restore affordance. While the
 * workbar is open, the matching toggle belongs to the workbar's tab toolbar:
 * tabs, new-tab and panel visibility are one local control group. That toolbar
 * occupies this same titlebar band, so the control keeps its screen position
 * across the hand-off instead of moving down into a second row.
 *
 * The titlebar is also the only row in the app that already knows where the
 * platform's native window controls are: `.maka-window-titlebar` reserves
 * `env(titlebar-area-*)` on both sides, so this button clears the macOS traffic
 * lights and the Windows caption strip without either platform being named
 * here. A toggle parked anywhere else would have to restate that.
