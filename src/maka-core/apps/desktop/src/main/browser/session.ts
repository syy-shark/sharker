/**
 * Owner of the live CDP connection into a conversation's embedded browser.

 * One connection per CONVERSATION: views (and their sealed ws bridges) belong
 * to a session, so session → endpoint is the identity mapping. Maka sessions
 * are FLAT (no parent chain), so the session id IS the conversation id — no
 * root-session walk, unlike PawWork. The connection is torn down when the
 * session is deleted or archived (releaseBrowserSession).
 *
 * opencli's CDPBridge.connect() registers its stealth script via
 * Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument, which only affects FUTURE documents.
 * Connecting before the view's first navigation covers the agent-first flow;
 * when the agent takes over a page the user already opened, that page predates
 * the script. It is reloaded once to harden it — but ONLY before the first
 * mutating action (click/type), never before a pure observe (snapshot / extract
 * / wait), so the agent merely looking at a page the user has open
 * cannot wipe their unsaved input. A navigation re-commits with the script, so
 * it just clears the pending takeover without a reload. (Reload is the only
 * contract-clean path — the stealth source itself is not a public export.)
