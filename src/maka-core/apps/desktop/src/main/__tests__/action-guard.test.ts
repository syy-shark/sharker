/**
 * Behavioral coverage for createKeyedActionGuard — the framework-free
 * multi-latch sibling of useOAuthLoginFlow's one-shot action guard, consumed
 * through useKeyedActionGuard by Settings components that hold several
 * independent action latches at once (the connection detail sheet's mutually
 * excluding actions and the memory controller's per-row action keys).
 *
 * The hook itself needs a DOM + React to render; the guard is pulled out
 * precisely so the safety behaviors the pages rely on — synchronous
 * re-entrancy rejection, per-key independence, exclusive acquisition, and
 * owner-checked release across reset() — are testable directly, without a
 * renderer.
