/**
 * Drag-to-grant permission onboarding — the lifecycle half.
 *
 * macOS gates Accessibility and Screen Recording behind TCC, and the
 * stock path is six steps ending in a file picker, which is where most
 * people give up. System Settings also accepts an `.app` bundle *dropped*
 * onto the permission list — the same explicit user consent Apple wants,
 * in one gesture. This controller runs that flow: open the right pane,
 * float a non-focusable card the user can drag the app out of, watch for
 * the grant, and get out of the way.
 *
 * Stage 1 (see docs/permission-onboarding-plan.md) is deliberately pure
 * Electron. The card is anchored to the cursor rather than docked to the
 * System Settings window, because locating a foreign window needs
 * `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` and therefore native code. Everything
 * else — the panel window, the drag, the poll — is stock, so Stage 1
 * ships without touching the build. Stage 2 adds the locator and docks.
 *
 * Every dependency is injected so the state machine is testable under
 * `node --test` with no Electron runtime and no real timers.
