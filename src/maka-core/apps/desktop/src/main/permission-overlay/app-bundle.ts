/**
 * Resolving the `.app` bundle to drag into System Settings.
 *
 * macOS accepts an application bundle dropped onto a Privacy list, which
 * is the whole point of the drag-to-grant flow — but it accepts *only* a
 * real `.app`, so the path has to be exact. Electron gives us the
 * executable inside the bundle, three levels down:
 *
 *   /Applications/Maka.app/Contents/MacOS/Maka   <- app.getPath('exe')
 *   /Applications/Maka.app/Contents/MacOS
 *   /Applications/Maka.app/Contents
 *   /Applications/Maka.app                       <- what we drag
 *
 * Under `MAKA_DEV_TCC=1` the same walk lands on the generated, signed
 * `Maka Dev.app`, which is also the TCC identity the user grants. Under a plain
 * `electron .` it lands on the npm `Electron.app`, which is the honest answer
 * for that setup even though macOS will not keep a grant for it. The only
 * genuinely unresolvable case is a layout where the walk doesn't end in `.app`
 * (e.g. an unpacked CI tree), and the caller degrades explicitly there
 * instead of starting a drag that can never be accepted.
 *
 * Pure + injectable so the walk is testable without an Electron runtime.
