/**
 * Cursor overlay window (main-process half) — the Maka-owned, Codex-style agent
 * cursor. A transparent, always-on-top, click-through BrowserWindow that hosts a
 * Canvas running the ported CursorEngine (Dubins glide + spring). MAIN drives it
 * with per-action coordinates; the window persists across actions and repositions
 * the cursor live over a one-way `overlay:move` channel (no teardown-per-move).
 *
 * Path 18 gates:
 *  - S13: action/session-scoped lifecycle; teardown is synchronous + event-driven,
 *    no timer keeps it alive.
 *  - S14 (load-bearing): `focusable:false` + `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true,{forward:true})`
 *    armed BEFORE show + `showInactive()` (never `.focus()`). The preload is
 *    RECEIVE-ONLY (main→renderer), so the overlay can never call back / inject.
 *  - S15: MAIN owns coordinates; the renderer only paints what MAIN sends.
 *  - S18: teardown is a single synchronous `destroy()`.
 *
 * Electron is required lazily so the module loads under `node --test`; tests
 * inject a fake window factory + bounds resolver.

/**
 * Two window levels, one per reason class, ported from Codex's
 * `OverlayWindowLevelReasons`.
 *
 * FLIGHT is `NSPopUpMenuWindowLevel + 1` = 102 = `kCGOverlayWindowLevel`, the
 * exact level Codex raises its cursor to while a reason holds. Above every
 * application window and above open menus (the agent drives menus, so the
 * cursor has to be visible over them), below the screen saver and below the
 * real hardware cursor. `'screen-saver'` — which this used to sit at
 * unconditionally — is 1000, high enough to paint over the screen saver and
 * over system alerts.
 *
 * REST is Codex's ordering, done the way Codex does it. Codex sinks the cursor
 * to the TARGET window's own level and calls `orderWindow(.above, relativeTo:)`
 * with the target's window number, so a window later raised over the target
 * covers the cursor too.
 *
 * This comment used to say Electron exposes no ordering relative to a foreign
 * window, and settled for `'floating'` (3) — above every ordinary application
 * window. That is the level a person reported twice as the cursor "leaking to
 * the foreground": an arrow hanging over whatever they were reading, pointing
 * at a window buried behind it.
 *
 * The claim was false for this Electron. `BrowserWindow.moveAbove(mediaSourceId)`
 * parses `window:<CGWindowID>:<n>` and calls
 * `orderWindowByShuffling:NSWindowAbove relativeTo:` — the same AppKit
 * primitive. Verified against foreign windows owned by other processes:
 *
 *   - `moveAbove` while always-on-top is a silent no-op. AppKit ordering is
 *     confined within a window level, so the level has to go first.
 *   - `setAlwaysOnTop(false)` alone is also not enough: it drops to layer 0 but
 *     leaves the overlay at the FRONT of it, still covering everything.
 *   - The two together both promote and demote, landing the overlay
 *     immediately above the named window, still unfocused.
 *   - An id that no longer names a window throws; a window that is alive but
 *     not in the ordered list (hidden, minimised, another Space) returns ok and
 *     orders the overlay to the front of its layer.
 *
 * `CURSOR_LEVEL.rest` therefore stays, as the fallback for the two cases where
 * ordering cannot be done: no usable target id, and a reorder that threw.
