/**
 * Picture-in-picture mirror of the window Computer Use is driving.
 *
 * The agent cursor can only be seen when the target window is. During ordinary
 * background work it is not: the user is looking at something else and the
 * driven window is underneath it. Codex answers this with
 * `CUAServiceRemoteHostedPIPController` — a live mirror of the window being
 * driven, with the agent cursor drawn into it. That is the real fix for
 * occlusion: stop competing for the user's screen and give the work its own
 * small window.
 *
 * This comment used to attribute that to a setting worded "Show backgrounded
 * apps that Computer Use is working on in Picture-in-Picture mode", and to
 * describe the mirror as gated on the app being backgrounded. Neither survives
 * inspection: that sentence has zero matches anywhere in the shipped app, the
 * real preference is an opt-OUT named `computerUseAlwaysHidePictureInPicture`
 * ("Always hide picture in picture"), and the trigger contains no occlusion
 * term at all — a notification when a new skyshot arrives, admitted when a turn
 * is active and that window has no stream yet. Occlusion appears nowhere in the
 * controller or in the host's visibility predicate.
 *
 * Codex streams via ScreenCaptureKit across XPC. Maka does not need either.
 * Every mutating action already returns a fresh screenshot of the target
 * (captured after the settle wait, so it shows the settled result), and that
 * frame is already in hand by the time the action completes. Mirroring it costs
 * nothing beyond the window. The trade is that this is a flipbook of
 * post-action frames rather than continuous video — enough to see what the
 * agent is doing, which is the point.

    /**
     * The run finished. Keep the mirror up for a while, then retire it.
     *
     * Destroying it the moment the turn ends takes the final state away at
     * exactly the moment a person wants to look at it: they were watching
     * background work precisely because they could not see the window, and the
     * answer arriving is when they look over. Codex holds the tile, plays a
     * completion effect on it, and removes it thirty seconds later.
     *
     * Not the same thing as stopping or deleting a session — those still tear
     * down immediately, because there the user has said they are done.
     *
     * This is also where a dismissal expires, and the reason it happens before
     * the early return: a hidden mirror has no window, so anything after the
     * `!win` check would never run for the case that needs it. `hide` is scoped
     * to a run and a run is a turn — the same turn end that brings
     * `computerUseOverlay.clearForSession` and `computerUseTools.clearSession`
     * brings this. Holding it for the whole session instead would leave a
     * follow-up driving another app for minutes with no mirror and no way to
     * ask for one back, short of stopping, archiving or deleting the session.
     * Between a control the user has to press twice and one they cannot undo,
     * the recoverable one wins.
