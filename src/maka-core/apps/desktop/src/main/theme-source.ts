 * `vibrancy: 'sidebar'` material (main-window.ts createWindow) reads its

 * that disagrees with the OS appearance leaves the vibrancy-backed sidebar
 * showing the *system* theme's tint while the rest of the (opaque) UI
 * repaints to the chosen one. Single conversion point for both the
 * createWindow() startup sync and the setThemeSource() IPC handler in
 * main-window.ts, so the two call sites can't drift out of sync with
