/**
 * Switching a session moves one row's selection. What it must not do is rewrite
 * the rest of the rail.
 *
 * Deliberately a budget on the OUTCOME rather than an assertion about
 * identities or `memo`. The rail's cost has had several independent causes —
 * `setActiveId` changing identity every AppShell render, `Intl` formatters
 * rebuilt per row, catalog refreshes replacing unchanged row objects — and each
 * was invisible to the others. A DOM-write budget catches all of them and the
 * ones not yet found, including anything that raises the number of commits a
 * switch produces (#4109).
 *
 * The counter reads inline `style` writes on rail buttons because that is the
 * dominant term: every Astryx button removes and re-adds its `anchor-name` per
 * render, so one wasted rail render is two style writes per button plus the
 * style recalculation they force.
 *
 * The assertion that carries the contract is `rowsTouched`, not the total.
 * Attributing each write to its row makes the budget independent of how many
 * rows the fixture seeds, and closes the hole a total-only budget leaves: a
 * regression that re-renders the whole rail exactly ONCE stays under any total
 * generous enough not to flake, but it cannot touch two rows. That is also the
 * missing middle of the fix's own claim — identity is fixed so `memo` holds, and
 * `memo` holding means untouched rows produce no DOM work at all.
 *
 * The last two assertions are the timing half, folded in from #4109's own rail
 * budget rather than kept as a second spec: how much was rewritten does not say
 * whether the user saw it. The selection must pass through exactly one row on
 * its way to the clicked one, and the status badges — which belong to sessions
 * whose state did not change — must not be torn down and rebuilt underneath it.
 *
 * `styleWrites > 0` is the counter's own liveness check. Every write counted
 * here comes from an Astryx ref callback that is not wrapped in `useCallback`;
 * if that upstream detail is ever memoised, both the healthy and the regressed
 * reading collapse to zero and a one-sided budget would pass forever without
 * ever failing again.
