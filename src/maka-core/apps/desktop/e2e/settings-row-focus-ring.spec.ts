/**
 * A settings row rings its OWN tab stop and nothing else.
 *
 * Astryx's Item draws `outline: 2px solid accent` at `:has(:focus-visible)`
 * unconditionally. That is right only for a row whose click target is the
 * invisible `<button>` Item renders for `onClick`/`href`. Every other row holds
 * a control that rings itself, so the row outline was a second ring around the
 * whole label + description + control band.
 *
 * Opening the 默认模型 picker showed it at its worst: a Selector popup is a
 * native `popover`, so the top layer moves where the popup PAINTS but not where
 * it sits in the DOM. Focus lands on the popup's search input, `:has()` walks
 * up to the row, and the row drew a full-width ring while the trigger drew
 * none — reported as "点开下拉框时外面整行都会出现一个蓝色的框".
 *
 * `packages/ui/src/styles.css` narrows the ring to the row's own tab stop.
 * Three things have to hold together, and a fix that over-reaches passes the
 * first two while failing the third:
 *
 *   1. an open picker leaves its row unringed,
 *   2. keyboard focus on a row control rings the CONTROL and not the row,
 *   3. a clickable row still rings, because there the ring IS the indicator.
 *
 * Computed style rather than a screenshot: the ring is one declaration, and
 * reading it back needs no tolerance for anti-aliasing or theme drift.
