// so without a `selectionchange` — so the quote hook, which re-reads the
// Selection 350ms after pointer release, finds nothing to offer.
//
// Not fixable from this repo as it stands: the rebuild is inside
// @astryxdesign/core, and pinning the `isStreaming` / `settledText` props that
// drive it still reproduces. Closing this needs an upstream fix, or a decision
// to snapshot the quote at pointerup — which would show a quote bar over text
// whose highlight the browser has already erased.
