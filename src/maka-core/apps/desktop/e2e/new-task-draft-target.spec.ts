 * directly under the composer — so "type, then pick where it runs" re-keyed the
 * slot mid-typing and swapped the text out for the new target's empty one.
 *
 * `chat-composer-region-draft-handoff.test.ts` pins the handoff at the

 * what re-keys the composer, and that the draft survives it.

 * Read the composer only after the click's render has committed AND its passive

 * passes against broken code — which is exactly what an earlier version of this
 * spec did. `newTaskTargetWindow` is shown for the same reason: a hidden
 * window's compositor is throttled to ~1fps, which stretched that gap from
 * 0.1ms to seconds and made every assertion here vacuous.
