# Abort-path upgrade backup/rollback for the one-click NSIS installer.
#
# Why this exists: electron-builder's default upgrade sequence runs the OLD
# uninstaller (which removes the whole $INSTDIR and the uninstall registry
# keys) before extracting the new files. A failure after that point strands
# the machine with no working install and no rollback source. This include
# adds a verified pre-upgrade backup and an Abort-path restore:
#
#   customInit        (before anything destructive) back up $INSTDIR to a
#                     same-volume sibling, verify the copy, mark it complete,
#                     and snapshot the registry values the template deletes.
#                     A backup failure or an empty registry snapshot fails the
#                     upgrade CLOSED (exit 101) with the old install intact.
#   customFiles_*     (after extraction, worst case: old files gone, new
#                     uninstaller/registry not yet written) test-only
#                     deterministic failpoints, read at run time:
#                     MAKA_INSTALLER_TEST_FAILPOINT=after-extract aborts here
#                     (the covered path); =after-extract-quit quits here,
#                     pinning the uncovered template Quit shape.
#   .onInstFailed     (any script Abort) two-step same-volume swap: move the
#                     partial new tree aside, move the backup into place, and
#                     only then discard the aside copy -- every intermediate
#                     state keeps at least one complete installation on disk.
#                     Exit 102 when the restore and registry write-back are
#                     verified, 103 otherwise. Every 103 keeps a launchable
#                     tree and recovery metadata; a sibling backup and note
#                     are guaranteed only when that copy completed.
#   customInstall     (success tail) delete the backup and any aside residue.
#
# Recovery story for hookless Quit, and for 103 when the sibling copy exists:
# "<install dir>.pre-upgrade-backup" holds a complete, verified copy plus
# RECOVERY-README.txt. A later installer adopts it only when its version marker
# matches the current or persisted registry snapshot. Every 103 keeps at least
# one launchable tree and recovery metadata, but rebuilding the sibling backup
# after a registry mismatch is best effort; without it, the next installer
# fails closed and manual repair/reinstall is required.
#
# What this does NOT cover (documented in docs/windows-support.md): failures
# that bypass NSIS's Abort path -- the template's own failure branches exit
# via Quit (old uninstaller failure, extraction retry exhaustion), which NSIS
# gives no hook for; a hard kill of the installer process; power loss. On
# those paths the backup and its recovery note are retained but no automatic
# restore runs. The backup copy is not forced through volatile device caches,
# in line with the repository's Windows durability boundary.
#
# Security posture of the failpoint (same narrative as MAKA_UPDATE_TEST_FEED):
# setting an environment variable on the installer's process already requires
# code execution as the same user, which under the per-user install model can
# rewrite the installation directory directly. The failpoint can only make an
# upgrade fail and roll back -- self-denial-of-service -- and it is read at
# run time (ReadEnvStr), never baked in at compile time. With the variable
# unset the only added behavior is one ReadEnvStr, the pre-upgrade backup,
# and the post-success backup removal.
#
# Compile-order note: this file is prepended to the generated script, before
# common.nsh/multiUser.nsh. Product defines arrive as makensis -D flags and
# are safe everywhere; template defines (INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY,
# APP_EXECUTABLE_FILENAME, ...) are only safe inside !macro bodies, which
# expand at their insertion points. Functions therefore read exclusively from
# the $maka* variables assigned in customInit.
