 *
 * Both sources are real. The canonical ledger starts empty at cutover and the
 * old table is never migrated into it — the old schema cannot express
 * `usageBasis` or `costBasis`, so a migration would have to invent one, landing
 * unpriced spend as `costUsd: 0`. Instead every all-time answer sums both and
 * says how much came from where, until the old table ages out of the queried
 * range and `legacyRecords` reaches zero on its own.
 *
 * History compaction calls have not yet been routed through the canonical seam
 * and still write only to the old table, so this merge keeps them counted in
 * the meantime. Historical records may also contain the retired
 * `semantic_compact` call kind.
