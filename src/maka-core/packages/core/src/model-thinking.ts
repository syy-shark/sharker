/**
 * Controllable thinking level for reasoning-capable models.
 *
 * A `ThinkingLevel` is a user-facing reasoning-depth knob. It is a per-model
 * variant: each model supports a subset of levels (declared here by
 * `thinkingVariantsForModel`), and switching models clears the choice so a
 * level is never sent to a model that does not understand it. `undefined`
 * means "no override" (the model's default behaviour) and is the only value
 * persisted-absent — the UI shows it as "默认". `'off'` explicitly disables
 * reasoning for providers that expose a true off switch (`reasoningEffort:
 * 'none'` for OpenAI gpt-5 / codex, `thinking: { type: 'disabled' }` for
 * Anthropic-protocol); providers without a clean off switch do not list it.
 *
 * The runtime maps a chosen level to the ai-sdk provider option
 * (`reasoningEffort` / `thinking.budgetTokens` / `thinkingConfig`) in
 * `buildProviderOptions`; this module owns only the vocabulary and the
 * per-model supported set, so the UI and runtime share one source of truth.

 * overrides Auto, because the runtime would otherwise believe a vision report
 * the provider may emit regardless.
 *
 * Declarations live on the connection as a first-class typed field
 * (`relayModelProfiles`, keyed by model id) rather than on the `models[]` rows
 * a catalog refresh rewrites, so they sit next to the user-edited connection
 * fields and survive it.
 *
 * The name is historical, and the table now splits by FIELD rather than by
 * provider. `contextWindow` and `vision` state facts about a model: a relay's
 * models are unknown to `model-metadata.ts`, but so is any model newer than
 * the bundled snapshot on any provider, and a provider without a model-list
 * endpoint cannot describe one either. Confining those to relays left the user
 * no way to state a context window Maka had no other way to learn (#1584).
 *
 * `thinkingLevels` and `serviceTier` stay relay-only: they name wire features
 * (`reasoning_effort` tiers, priority processing) that only the
 * OpenAI-compatible relays accept. `assertProfileFieldsFitProvider` in the
 * catalog codec is the write seam that enforces it, so reads here do not
 * re-derive it; `supportsRelayFastServiceTier` below is a narrower read-side
 * question — which relay MODELS carry the tier.
 *
 * One invariant is still enforced at the store boundaries: declarations exist
 * only for models in `enabledModelIds` (disabling a model deletes its
