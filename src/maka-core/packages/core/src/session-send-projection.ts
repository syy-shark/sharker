/**
 * Session send projection — pure, sync compatibility answer for an existing
 * session's stored model target. #1038.
 *
 * This is the shared compatibility projection used by Desktop onboarding and
 * the renderer session-health notice above the composer. Runtime Host owns the
 * authoritative submission and execution path; this projection only explains
 * whether that exact target looks usable for presentation and readiness checks.
 *
 * The compatibility rules are:
 *   1. The session's own connection must pass `isConnectionReady` with
 *      the sticky session model.
 *   2. Legacy Sessions without an immutable connection id are blocked until
 *      the user explicitly selects an account.
 *   3. A missing id, slug mismatch, or unusable exact connection is blocked.
 *
 * `lastTestStatus` deliberately plays no part here (E4): telemetry about
 * a past credential test must not gate send, so it must not gate the
 * notice's "send will fail" answer either.
