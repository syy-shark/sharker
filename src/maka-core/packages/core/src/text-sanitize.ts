/**
 * Unicode text-sanitize pipeline — single source of truth (#1404).
 *
 * `session-name.ts` and `foreign-session.ts` each used to carry their own copy
 * of the "NFC + control/bidi/zero-width + whitespace-collapse + code-point
 * cap" pipeline, and the two had drifted: `session-name` was missing 8 code
 * points that `foreign-session` (and its own `FOREIGN_UNSAFE_CHARS` id guard)
 * already covered. This module is the one place that pipeline lives now.
 *
 * Boundary: this helper does ONE thing — given an already-type-checked string,
 * clean it and cap it. It is deliberately agnostic about:
 *   - the runtime type guard (`unknown` → reject vs coerce),
 *   - the empty-after-sanitize policy (reject vs return `''`),
 *   - the return shape (`Result` vs bare string).
 * Those are caller policies and stay with the callers, so each surface keeps
 * its existing contract while sharing the same character classes.
 *
 * NOT a security boundary on its own — NFC canonicalization doesn't stop bidi
 * spoofing; the bidi/zero-width steps below do. Apply at every trust boundary
 * where untrusted text may reach storage or a prompt.

// Regex character classes use escaped `\uXXXX` ranges, NOT literal control

// source grep. The `\u....` form compiles to an identical regex at runtime but
// keeps the source readable as plain text.

// C0 control characters: U+0000..U+001F (NUL through US), U+007F (DEL),
