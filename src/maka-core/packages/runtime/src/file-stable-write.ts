// packages/runtime/src/file-stable-write.ts
// The fd-pinned mutation primitive enforcing the filesystem-authority contract
// (#2600). A path-based write re-opens the pathname after every check, so a
// swap between validation and the open diverts the write onto the replacement
// and the post-write check can only *report* the corruption afterwards. This
// module removes that window structurally: the approved object is opened once,
// its identity is validated on the descriptor itself (fstat, not a second
// pathname lookup), and the read/transform/write all run through that same
// descriptor — a path swap mid-operation cannot redirect the bytes.
//
// Missing targets are created with `wx` (exclusive): if the path appeared
// between authorisation and the open, EEXIST is reported as `path_changed`
// rather than truncating whatever landed there.
//
// The descriptor is validated BEFORE any truncation: an 'r+' open does not
// truncate, so a rejected validation leaves the file byte-for-byte intact —
// unlike a plain 'w' open, which truncates as part of opening.
