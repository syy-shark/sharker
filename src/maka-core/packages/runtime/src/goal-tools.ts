/**
 * What a declined Goal mutation tells the model to do next.
 *
 * These four tools all failed the same way and said so in one sentence: the
 * turn no longer owns Goal control. Opaque, but it asked for nothing. Replacing
 * it with a single cause and a retry made it worse, because only one of the
 * causes is a race. A turn that was never registered under a Goal boundary —
 * every turn started with `goalBoundary: 'none'`, and every turn whose session
 * was closed and removed — declines permanently. Told to call GoalStatus and
 * then retry "if there is still no active goal", such a turn gets "No goal set
 * for this session", satisfies the condition, retries, and receives the
 * identical refusal, forever.
 *
 * So a retry is prescribed only where a retry can succeed — and that turned out
 * to be nowhere. `goal_changed` reads like a race, and it is one, but the loser
 * of that race cannot re-enter it: `observedControlLease` is written once in
 * `beginObservedTurn` and refreshed only by a mutation that succeeds, so once
 * the lease has moved on, every gate this turn passes through declines with the
 * same cause until the turn ends. Driven against the real coordinator — one
 * turn registers, a second arms a goal and clears it — GoalSet declines
 * `goal_changed` on the first call and on the fourth, and GoalStatus in between
 * reports a goal that only makes the model want to call again.
 *
 * `goal_already_armed` is the same shape. It is reachable from GoalSet only
 * once the armed goal has left `active` — otherwise the "unfinished goal is
 * active" guard answers first — and by then `registration.controlLease` is set
 * and nothing this turn can call will clear it, because clearing it requires a
 * mutation that the moved lease also declines.
 *
 * Every branch therefore ends by closing the retry. Reading the goal is still
 * safe, so GoalStatus is still offered where it would tell the model something
 * it does not know; it is offered as the last thing to do, not as a step on the
 * way back to the call that just failed.
 *
 * The advice also has to know which tool it is answering. `goal_already_armed`
 * is produced by the activation gate, and GoalResume goes through that gate too
 * — so a turn that arrived while a goal was active, paused it and then tried to
 * resume it read "this turn cannot arm a second one" in reply to a request that
 * asked to arm nothing. Same cause, different thing to say about it.
 *
 * "Already armed" was also the wrong noun for the cause. A turn holds the lease
 * either because it armed a goal or because `beginObservedTurn` bound it to a
 * goal that was already active — the second turn never armed anything. What the
 * gate observes is a binding, so that is what the sentence names.
