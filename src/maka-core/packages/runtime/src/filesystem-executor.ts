// One decision — the active ExecutionBoundary — picks the backend and the path
// scope; the tools carry no policy branch and no executor carries a containment
// rule of its own. Before this seam existed each file tool repeated the same
// worker-versus-executor branch, and the fallback executor hard-coded a session-cwd
// containment that no permission profile actually declares. A bypass boundary
// skipped the worker, so that undeclared rule became the only arbiter and made
// "full access" stricter than ask mode, which grants :slash_tmp outright (#2083).
