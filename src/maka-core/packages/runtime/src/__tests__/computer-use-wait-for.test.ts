// Waiting for the thing, instead of waiting a number.
//
// The only wait there was slept for a duration the model had to guess. After an
// action that opens something — a sheet, a save panel, a progress bar — the
// right length is not knowable in advance, so the guess is either too short and
// the next observe finds nothing, or too long and every wait costs that much.
//
// Playwright's `browser_wait_for` takes `text` / `textGone` for exactly this,
// and it is the only condition a model can state: it has just read the window,
// so it knows what should appear in it. Neither Codex nor cua-driver exposes any
// wait condition at all.
