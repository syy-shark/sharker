/**
 * The tool takes arguments through two schemas, and they are written by hand.
 *
 * `computerWireParams` is the flat object the SDK validates a model's call
 * against — one shape covering every action, most fields optional.
 * `computerParams` is the strict discriminated union the tool narrows to before
 * it does anything. A field has to exist in both: the first to be accepted off
 * the wire, the second to survive narrowing.
 *
 * `window_action` existed in the union and not on the wire, and was therefore
 * unreachable from the day it shipped. Nothing failed — the SDK rejected those
 * calls above the layer the debug journal records, the unit tests exercised the
 * union directly, and the real-machine probe went around the tool entirely. It
 * took a model saying it had tried the action, and a trace showing no such call
 * had ever been made, to find it.
 *
 * A sample-driven test cannot catch the next one, because the next one will be
 * an action nobody thought to sample. Everything here walks a schema.
