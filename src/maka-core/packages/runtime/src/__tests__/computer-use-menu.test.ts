// The menu bar as the model reads it.
//
// Against a five-model, six-task real-machine matrix, three of the four tasks
// that failed for every model failed on one fact: no observation this executor
// produced contained a single menu element. Save as PDF, find in project and
// rotate image are menu commands and nothing in a window reaches them.
//
// Shipping the menu is not the same as shipping it usably. A whole menu bar is
// larger than most windows — TextEdit's is 369 elements against 16 — so what is
// asserted here is the shape that makes it affordable to carry on every
// observation, and the sentence without which a model cannot act on it.
