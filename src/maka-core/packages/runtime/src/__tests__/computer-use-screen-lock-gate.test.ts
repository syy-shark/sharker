/**
 * The `screen_locked` producer.
 *
 * `screen_locked` existed as an outcome code, a session status, a block reason
 * and a `screenUnlocked` release long before anything could ever produce it, so
 * locking the machine mid-run did not stop Computer Use from driving it. These
 * tests are written against the tool surface rather than against a lock monitor:
 * a monitor that answers correctly and is never asked is exactly the defect.
