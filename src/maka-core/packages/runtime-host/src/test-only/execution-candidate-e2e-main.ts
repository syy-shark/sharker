/**
 * Desktop E2E candidate entry. It exists so the production entry
 * (`execution-candidate-main.ts`) carries no import of the E2E composition and
 * no `--desktop-e2e` branch: the entry file IS the switch, which is what keeps
 * FakeBackend and this bootstrap out of the release artifacts.
 *
 * The E2E run still goes through the real Runtime Host composition — only the
 * `primaryBackendFactory` seam is substituted.
