/**
 * Small pure helpers backing the chat surface (TurnView,
 * RelativeTime, AssistantAnswerBubble, etc.) —
 * time formatters, turn duration + abort marker copy.
 *
 * PR-UI-LIB-EXTRACT-4 (round 5/10) introduced this module with a
 * deliberate ESM circular import on `./components.js` for
 * locale resolution. PR-UI-LIB-EXTRACT-5 (round 6/10) broke the
 * cycle by lifting locale helpers into a new `locale-helpers`
 * leaf module; this file now depends on that leaf instead.
 *
 * Why this seam: duration formatting has ms→s→m bucket rules, and
 * the abort-marker label is i18n-able copy. Each rule was
 * previously buried between TurnView's 200-line JSX block and
 * the answer bubble's rendering lifecycle; the bundle now
 * sits as short pure functions easy to unit-test in isolation.
 *
 * PR-CHAT-CHROME-FOLLOWUP-0: `messageRoleLabel` / `avatarInitial`
 * were removed — the chat surface dropped per-message avatars and
 * name labels (MessageMeta), leaving both helpers with zero call
 * sites.

/* `formatAbsoluteTimestamp` used to live here as a second copy of the same
   `Intl` options `@maka/core/relative-time` already owned, and it built a
   formatter per call — the sidebar renders one per row for the row tooltip and
   one for the row's accessible name. Its callers now read the core module
   directly, so there is no second reading of a timestamp to keep in step. */

/* `formatClockTime` (a 24-hour `HH:mm` for the user-message time) lived here
   until the meta row moved to Astryx's `Timestamp`. Locking the hour cycle was
   the app overriding a preference that belongs to the reader's system, which is
   why `Timestamp` formats against the host locale and offers no hour-cycle
   knob. Absolute readings now come from that component, not from a local bag of
   `Intl` options. */

/**
 * A turn's duration, counted in whole seconds: `0s`, `25s`, `1m 54s`.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT tool-activity's `formatDuration`, which resolves below the
 * second (`450 ms`, `8.2s`). That shape reports a span measured after the fact.
 * A turn's duration is first read while it advances, one second at a time, in
 * the live status line, and a counter must only show precision its own tick can
 * deliver — a tenths digit driven by a one-second timer moves in visible jumps,
 * and a millisecond reading claims an accuracy the interval never had. The
 * settled turn's meta tooltip uses the same shape rather than a finer one, so a
 * turn that read `25s` while it ran does not report a differently-rounded
 * number afterwards. Seconds truncate rather than round so the counter never
 * runs ahead of the time it reports.
