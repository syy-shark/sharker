// packages/ui/src/use-roving-row-focus.ts
//
// Roving tabindex over a selectable list, so the whole list is ONE tab stop.
//
// Why this exists: a list of N selectable rows where every per-item action
// lives in an inspector AFTER the list puts the inspector N−k tab presses away
// from row k. The row is the cheap part of the journey and the actions are the
// expensive part, which is backwards. Arrow keys are the right instrument for
// moving inside a homogeneous set; Tab is for moving between regions, and it
// should cost one press to leave the list no matter which row you are on.
//
// The rows are rendered by the design system's List/ListItem, which owns the
// focusable element itself — an "invisible button" inside each `li` that takes
// no `tabIndex` from the call site. So the tabindex is written onto those
// buttons directly, in a layout effect, which is the same DOM seam the panel
// already reaches through to restore focus after a delete. Focus itself stays
// where the user put it: arrows move focus, Enter/Space select, and selection
// never follows focus — the inspector is too expensive a side effect to fire
// on a plain arrow press.

 * from the DOM rather than tracked as refs because the list markup belongs to
 * the design system, and the row order is exactly the DOM order.

  // No dependency array on purpose, and it is load-bearing twice over. React
  // never wrote these tabindexes, so it cannot restore them: any render that
  // mounts a fresh row button — a new reminder, a filter change — hands us a
  // node at its default tabindex 0, which puts the list back in the tab order.
  // And the stop has to follow `activeIndex` after every arrow press, or Tab
  // out and back would return to whichever row the user left long ago.
  // Running on every render is what covers both; it is also why this reads
  // `activeIndex` straight from the render closure rather than through a ref.

    // Assign only on a change. Writing `tabIndex` invalidates style even when
    // the value is identical, and this effect runs on every render of a list
    // that is usually untouched — the unconditional write was charged 224ms of
    // forced reflow. A fresh row still gets its tabindex: it arrives at the
    // default 0, which differs from -1 for every row but the active one.
