  // grouping am I in?" and then answered it with a radio dot.
  //
  // Text labels, not icons: a clock and a folder are two icons the rail has to
  // teach, and it never had anywhere to teach them — 按时间 / 按项目 is the
  // whole vocabulary and it fits. The control spans the rail's full width so
  // the two segments are one object with a visible current half, rather than a
  // pair of small buttons floating beside a title.
  //
  // It lives here, in the sticky top region, and NOT as a list heading's
  // endContent: the heading is gone (the rail landmark already names the panel,
  // so "会话" was a label for a list that is the only thing under it), and a
  // switch that scrolls away with the list it switches is a switch you have to
  // scroll back up to find. Collapsed at 48px there is no room for either
  // segment's label, and the list it governs is not rendered at all.
