/**
 * PR-UI-12 review fixup #2 (@kenji A3 review msg 365ff8b9).
 *
 * Pure helper for accepting a single `tool_output_delta` chunk into
 * the running `outputChunks: ToolOutputChunk[]` array. Three concerns
 * the renderer was previously trusting main-side to handle, now
 * enforced on the renderer side too as defense in depth:
 *
 *   1. **Secondary redaction**: every incoming chunk's `text` is
 *      run through the shared `redactSecrets` helper BEFORE the
 *      chunk lands in React state. The renderer cannot trust the
 *      main-side runtime to have masked every secret — tool stderr
 *      / provider error bodies sometimes leak credentials past the
 *      runtime tail-window redactor, and a streaming path that
 *      stored raw text would expose the secret in:
 *        - React state snapshots (DevTools, Redux-style time-travel)
 *        - the "copy chunk" affordance
 *        - any future serialization that walks `outputChunks`.
 *      If redaction changes the text, the resulting chunk's
 *      `redacted` flag is forced to `true` so the UI shows the
 *      "[已脱敏]" hint regardless of what the upstream event
 *      claimed.
 *
 *   2. **Per-chunk cap**: a single chunk whose `text.length` exceeds
 *      `maxChunkChars` is truncated and tail-padded with a clear
 *      marker. The runtime's tool output tailing should usually
 *      prevent this, but a misbehaving tool could ship a single
 *      huge chunk; the renderer must not blindly store a multi-MB
 *      string into state.
 *
 *   3. **Per-tool cap**: once the merged `outputChunks` exceeds
 *      `maxChunks` count OR `maxTotalChars` total characters,
 *      oldest chunks are dropped until both invariants hold again.
 *      This bounds renderer memory and prevents a flood of events
 *      from a runaway tool from forcing arbitrarily large state.
 *      A dropped-chunks marker is emitted as a separate
 *      `truncated: true` outcome so the UI can show a "已截断" pill.
 *
 * Dedup-by-seq and sort-by-seq stay (runtime already enforces
 * per-toolCallId monotonic seq, but the network can deliver out of
 * order; insert-sort handles both).
 *
 * The function is pure and renderer-agnostic — tests live in
 * `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/tool-output-stream.test.ts` and
 * exercise:
 *   - raw `Authorization: Bearer ...` / API-key text → masked in
 *     stored chunk + `redacted: true`
 *   - single oversize chunk → truncated to `maxChunkChars`
 *   - 1000 small chunks → state capped at `maxChunks` (oldest drops)
 *   - total chars over `maxTotalChars` → oldest drops to fit
 *   - dedup-by-seq still works
 *   - sort-by-seq still works (out-of-order arrival)
 *   - `truncated: false` when no cap hit

 *   - 200 chunks: enough headroom that streamed line-by-line
 *     output of a 100-line script never hits the cap, while still
 *     bounding state churn for runaway tools.
 *   - Runtime event limit per chunk: matches
 *     `TOOL_OUTPUT_DELTA_MAX_CHARS` so renderer cap is consistent
 *     with main-side truncation; a chunk that arrives larger than

 *     (Tail-keep, not head-keep, so the most recent output is what
 *     the user sees; matches a `tail -c` mental model.)
 *   - Dedups by `seq` (returns `prev` unchanged if the seq is
 *     already present).
 *   - Inserts in sorted order by `seq`.
 *   - Drops oldest chunks until `length <= maxChunks` AND total
 *     chars `<= maxTotalChars`. Sets `truncated: true` if any drop
 *     or per-chunk truncation occurred.
