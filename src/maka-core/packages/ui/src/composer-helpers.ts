/**
 * Pure helpers backing the Composer panel's draft + history behavior.
 *
 * PR-UI-LIB-EXTRACT-1 (WAWQAQ msg `510fef52`, round 2/10): pulled
 * out of the 8500-line `components.tsx` kitchen-sink. All five
 * helpers were already exported from `@maka/ui` (consumed by the
 * desktop renderer's OnboardingHero, plus four contract tests), so
 * this is a file-level seam — the public API is unchanged: the
 * package index re-exports the helpers from this module instead of
 * from `components.tsx`. byte-for-byte equivalent, zero behavior
 * change.
 *
 * Why: composer draft / history state is pure data manipulation
 * (Map + array slicing) and benefits from being testable without
 * booting the JSX surface. Keeping it next to the giant Composer
 * `forwardRef` made it impossible to read either the helpers OR the
 * panel in isolation.
