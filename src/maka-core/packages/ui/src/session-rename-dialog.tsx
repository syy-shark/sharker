/**
 * Renaming from the sidebar, as a dialog rather than in place.
 *
 * The row is an Astryx `SideNavItem`: `label` is a `string` and the whole row
 * is one `<button>`, which no text field may live inside. Editing in place
 * therefore meant swapping the row for a stand-in that had to re-state
 * everything the real row brings — its height and insets, its leading icon and
 * trailing column, and (worst) the subtree, since a parent's descendants live
 * inside the same component. Every one of those was a bug before it was a
 * feature. A dialog costs one glance and leaves the row untouched.
 *
 * The titlebar keeps its in-place edit, and this is not an inconsistency: there
 * the name is the open session's own heading and the breadcrumb crumb is a
 * standalone element built to be replaced. Here the name is one property of a
 * list item, reached through the same `⋯` menu as archive and delete — a
 * dialog is what those actions already look like.
 *
 * One button, no 取消: the header's close control and Escape are already two
 * ways out, which is the convention `ScheduledTaskFormDialog` set.
