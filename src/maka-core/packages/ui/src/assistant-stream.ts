/**
 * PR-UI-Cx (@kenji C1 residual note msg aa2d26a7) — the assistant

 * `LiveTurnProjection`.
 *
 * The pipeline itself lives in `stream-delta`, which this module and
 * `thinking-stream` share; everything below is the assistant's own caps,
 * markers, and recovery direction. Assistant text head-keeps because the user
 * reads a reply top-down — see `stream-delta` for why thinking does not.

/**
 * Default caps. Tuned to:
 *   - 4 KB per single delta: matches A3 tool-output's per-chunk
 *     cap and the runtime's `TOOL_OUTPUT_DELTA_MAX_CHARS`. Streaming
 *     models normally emit ≤ a few hundred chars per delta; a single
 *     4KB+ delta is misbehavior and gets tail-kept.
 *   - 256 KB total per session: a generous bound for ONE assistant
 *     turn. A typical model reply runs 200B-30KB; long-form code +
 *     prose can hit ~80KB; 256KB caps a runaway stream while
 *     leaving 99% of legitimate replies untouched. Past this cap,
 *     further deltas are dropped (the buffer freezes with a
 *     trailing marker; the user sees the head of the answer plus
 *     "[…后续已截断]" — not a silently-truncated mess).
