/**
 * The transcript's scroll commands, and the seam that hands the scroller to the
 * authority that owns it (`transcript-scroll-authority.ts`).
 *
 * A command is one-shot — jump to a turn the reader picked, ask for the history
 * above them — and it releases the pin first, because the authority writes
 * nothing while the pin is released and so a command can never be fighting a
 * policy. That was the shape every previous round of this code had.
 *
 * What decides whether the reader wants either thing is never re-derived here.
 * "They have left the tail" is the pin, and the pin has one owner. Nothing here
 * compensates for content that lands above them either; `overflow-anchor: auto`
 * does that continuously, and for free.
