/**
 * UI locale detection + prompt-suggestion copy.
 *
 * PR-UI-LIB-EXTRACT-5 (WAWQAQ msg `510fef52`, round 6/10): pulled
 * out of `components.tsx`. Locale types and
 * `getPromptSuggestions` were already public exports from
 * `@maka/ui` (consumed by the renderer's main.tsx, OnboardingHero,
 * theme.ts, e2e-fixture fixture, and the
 * text-file-import contract test); `PROMPT_SUGGESTIONS_BY_LOCALE`,
 * `PromptSuggestion`, and `PromptSuggestionLocale` were
 * panel-internal. byte-for-byte equivalent; behavior unchanged;
 * `index.ts` re-exports the new module so the public API surface
 * stays identical.
 *
 * Why this seam (round 6 follow-up to round 5):
 *   1. Locale detection is the single source of truth referenced
 *      by SO many surfaces (chat empty-hero, composer placeholders,
 *      onboarding hero, Intl.DateTimeFormat language) that giving
 *      it its own home is the natural cut.
 *   2. Round 5 introduced a deliberate ESM circular import — the
 *      new `chat-display-helpers.ts` needed locale state from
 *      `components.tsx`, while `components.tsx` imports its time
 *      formatters from `chat-display-helpers.ts`. Safe but ugly.
 *      Moving locale helpers here broke the cycle: both
 *      `components.tsx` and `chat-display-helpers.ts` now depend on
 *      this leaf module, with no edges between them in this
 *      dimension.

/**
 * PR-UI-14 (@yuejing 2026-05-22): locale-aware prompt suggestions.
 *
 * Audit §3.7 — the v1 chip set was 6 dev-heavy zh prompts (code review,
 * unit tests, debugging…). Two problems:
 *   1. English-locale users saw a wall of Chinese chips on first run.
 *   2. Non-developer users (PMs, writers, students) saw nothing
 *      universally relevant — the chips read as "Maka is only for
 *      programmers".
 *
 * Fix: select a complete catalog from the LocaleProvider value and
 * return a balanced mix of dev + general starting points. Each locale
 * keeps 3 dev chips (codebase summary / explain code / Code review)
 * for the power-user path and adds 3 general chips (read a long doc,
 * translate, draft a message) so the empty-chat surface reads as a
 * general assistant first, a coding assistant second.
