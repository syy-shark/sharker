// that reaches it. See apps/desktop/stories/FIDELITY.md.
//
// This file had four stories and three of them rendered nothing. The strip
// reports by exception — `capabilityAuditIssues` returns [] and the component
// returns null unless a source needs auth or is erroring, or a scheduled task
// failed or was skipped — and `report()` defaults all four of those counts to
// 0. So the former healthy-focus and empty stories were blank
// panels carrying confident "Real path:" sentences that described behavior the
// component lost when it stopped summarizing healthy state. The app state they
// named is "this strip is not on the page", which needs no story.

/**
 * The skills page's frame: the wrapper the strip renders inside on the real
 * page (skills-panel.tsx) — `.maka-module-page-panel`, a padded grid block
 * in the module page's single scrolling content column. The previous frame
 * here exercised a `.maka-module-main` grid row assignment and its
 * `:has(> .maka-capability-audit-strip)` third-row rule; both were deleted
 * when the module pages moved onto the Astryx Layout shell (#2236), where
 * the strip is ordinary content, not a grid row.
 *
 * What this frame does not reproduce: the 900px centred column, which is
 * Astryx LayoutContent's own box. Width measurements taken here do not
 * transfer to the app; the strip's internal rhythm does. The scheduled-task
 * page mounts the same component inside `.maka-module-page-body` — a
 * different padded block in the same kind of column — and the same caveat
 * applies there.
