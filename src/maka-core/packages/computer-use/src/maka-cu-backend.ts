// The `maka.cu/2` CuDispatchBackend. Speaks the host protocol (`maka-cu`'s
// docs/HOST_PROTOCOL.md) to `maka-cu`, the native macOS executor; section
// numbers in comments refer to that document.
//
// The point of this backend, next to the cua-driver one, is that frame binding
// lives in the executor. A dispatch quotes a snapshot id, an element token and
// the digest the host was given, and the executor answers `snapshot_spent`,
// `element_changed`, `element_released` or `process_replaced` instead of
// re-resolving an index against whatever the tree looks like now. So this file
// has no re-match pass, no occlusion geometry and no path guessing: it carries
// identity down and maps declared answers back.
//
// It is OFF by default (see select-backend.ts). The executor it talks to does
// not exist as a signed artifact yet, so nothing may fall back to it silently.
//
// What the protocol declares and Maka's own types cannot yet carry: per-element
// `truncated`, `actions`, `placeholder`, `focused` and per-snapshot
// `selectedText`. They are read and validated here — a missing declared field is
// version skew the host must catch — but only the truncation flags reach
// anywhere, through `onTrace`. Giving them a model-facing home means new fields
// on `CuObservedElement`/`CuObservation`, which this change deliberately does
// not make.
