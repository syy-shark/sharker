# Drag-to-grant permission onboarding (macOS)

Status: **Stage 1 built** (`apps/desktop/src/main/permission-overlay/`,
`apps/desktop/src/overlay/permission-overlay.*`). Stage 2 is still a proposal.
Written 2026-07-27 for maka.

## The problem

macOS gates Accessibility and Screen Recording behind TCC, and the stock
flow is hostile: the user must open System Settings, find Privacy &
Security, find the right pane, press `+`, navigate a file picker to
`/Applications`, choose `Maka.app`, then come back and tick a checkbox.
Six steps, and the file picker is where most people give up.

maka today does the honest-but-minimal thing: `permissions-actions.ts`
deep-links into the right pane and stops there
(`apps/desktop/src/main/permissions-actions.ts:52`). Everything after the
deep link is on the user.

Apple's design intent is that the user *explicitly* adds the app — that
part is not worth circumventing. But System Settings also accepts an
`.app` bundle **dropped** onto the permission list, which satisfies the
same intent in one gesture. That is the whole trick.

## What we're copying, and from where

Two independent implementations of the same idea:

- [`riko2chen/AskForPermission`](https://github.com/riko2chen/AskForPermission)
  — MIT, native Swift/AppKit. Not directly usable (maka is Electron) but
  its window-location approach is the correct one.
- Alma (closed-source; behaviour observed in the local `~/alma-re`
  study archive). Electron, so its shape maps onto maka almost directly.

**We take the technique, not the code.** No Alma source is copied into
this repo, and `~/alma-re` stays out of the tree.

## The mechanism

Four APIs, only one of which is exotic:

| Piece | API | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Non-focus-stealing card | `BrowserWindow` `{type:'panel', focusable:false, transparent:true, frame:false}` + `setAlwaysOnTop(true,'screen-saver')` + `showInactive()` | All four are load-bearing. Drop any one and the card steals focus, which drops System Settings' drop-target highlight mid-drag. |
| Follows the Settings window | `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` | **Not reachable from Electron** — see below. |
| The drag itself | `webContents.startDrag({file, icon})` | Stock Electron. Writes a `kUTTypeFileURL` onto `NSPasteboard`, which is what makes the drop legible to another process. An HTML5 `dragstart` cannot cross the process boundary. |
| Grant detection | `systemPreferences.isTrustedAccessibilityClient(false)` / `getMediaAccessStatus('screen')` on a ~1.5s poll | There is no usable notification for these; polling is the state of the art. |

### The one hard constraint

Electron exposes no API for another application's window geometry —
`screen.*` covers displays and the cursor only. The single
permission-free source on macOS is `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`: window
*images* require Screen Recording, but the *metadata* (`kCGWindowBounds`,
`kCGWindowOwnerPID`) does not. That distinction is what avoids the
chicken-and-egg of asking for Accessibility using an API that itself
requires Accessibility.

Explicitly ruled out: `osascript` / System Events
(`get position of window 1 of process "System Settings"`) needs both
Accessibility and an Automation grant — exactly the deadlock we're
trying to escape.

So the docking effect costs one native call. Three ways to get it:

1. **Prebuilt Swift CLI in `Resources/`, spawned as a child process.**
   ~50KB universal binary, signed and notarised with the app. No
   node-gyp, no N-API/ABI coupling, cannot crash the main process.
   **Recommended.**
2. **Compile Swift at runtime on first use, cache the binary.** Alma's
   approach. Zero build-system work, but it hard-depends on Xcode
   Command Line Tools at runtime — absent on most non-developer Macs —
   and Alma's version fails *silently* when they are.
3. **Node addon (koffi / N-API).** Avoids a process spawn per tick, but
   buys ABI coupling and a rebuild every Electron bump for a call made
   ~5×/second. Not worth it.

Note the cost model in (1) and (2): a tracker polling at 200ms spawns a
process 5×/second for the life of the overlay. Acceptable for a
short-lived onboarding overlay; it should not become a general facility.

## Staging

**Stage 1 — pure Electron, no native code. DONE.** Everything except
docking: the panel window, the deep link, the drag, the poller, the
grant→close lifecycle, the copy. The card anchors to
`screen.getCursorScreenPoint()`, clamped into that display's work area —
the user just clicked our button, so the cursor is a good proxy for where
they are looking, and it lands on the display they are actually using.

Entry point is 引导授权 / "Guide me" in Settings →  , shown only
for the two drag-to-grant permissions and only where `canOpenSettings`
is true (main sets it on darwin alone). The plain "open System Settings"
link stays beside it — the drag is a shortcut, never the only route.

The lifecycle lives in `permission-overlay-controller.ts`, fully injected
and covered by `permission-overlay-controller.test.ts` with a fake clock:
no window or timer stacking on re-entry, teardown on grant / dismiss /
window-gone, and a give-up timeout so an abandoned flow cannot leave an
immortal always-on-top card (a hole both reference implementations have).

**Stage 2 — add the locator binary** as progressive enhancement. Not built. When it
returns a frame, the card docks to the Settings window and follows it;
when it returns `null`, fall back to the Stage 1 anchor. Unlike Alma,
log the degradation loudly — a silent fallback is indistinguishable
from a bug.

## Stage 2 landmine: the two coordinate spaces do not match

The reference locator returns **AppKit** coordinates — origin bottom-left
of the containing screen:

```swift
y = screen.frame.maxY - localY - cgFrame.height
```

with a comment claiming that is what `setBounds` expects. It is not.
Electron normalises screen coordinates to **top-left** origin on macOS,
so feeding it a bottom-left `y` is a space mismatch. The docking math
then adds a small offset (`y = frame.y + 14`) meaning "just below the
window top", and the two spaces agree only when

```
screenHeight - windowTop - windowHeight  ==  windowTop
```

i.e. only when the Settings window is **vertically centred** — which is
exactly where it opens by default, so the bug is invisible in a demo.
Worked through for a 900px screen and a 600px window:

| Settings window top | y passed to setBounds | intended | drift |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 60  | 254 | 74  | **+180** |
| 150 (centred) | 164 | 164 | 0 |
| 250 | 64  | 264 | **−200** |

So the card is correctly placed until the user moves the Settings window,
then slides the wrong way by twice the displacement.

Stage 2 must either return CG (top-left) coordinates and skip the AppKit
conversion entirely, or convert and then convert back. Whichever we pick,
the tracker needs a test that moves the window off-centre — a fixture
using the default position proves nothing.

## Design notes worth stealing

- **The drag image should look like the destination row**, not like the
  app icon: a small canvas-rendered replica of a System Settings list
  row (icon + "Maka"). What you drag looks like what it becomes, which
  is what makes the gesture read as obvious.
- **Flight animation:** quadratic Bézier with the control point lifted
  `clamp(0.18 × distance, 44, 140)`px, over ~720ms on a critically
  damped spring. The arc is what signals "this belongs over there".
  Skip it in Stage 1 — with no real target it is decoration. Gate it on
  `prefers-reduced-motion` either way.
- **Screen Recording needs an extra beat:** macOS caches the old denial,
  so a freshly granted app often still reads `denied`. The honest fix is
  copy — after ~8s, tell the user a relaunch is required.

## Gaps to fix rather than inherit

Both references have holes worth not copying:

- **No detection that the user closed System Settings or gave up.** The
  card just freezes in place, always-on-top across every Space, until
  it is dismissed by hand. maka should treat "Settings went away" and a
  give-up timeout as real states.
- **No dev-mode affordance.** When there is no `.app` to drag, the
  mousedown silently does nothing. Fall back to "reveal in Finder" or a
  copy-path button so the flow degrades to something usable.
- **Stacked pollers.** Alma pushes a new subscriber and restarts the
  tracker on each entry point, so two paths onto the same window stack
  duplicate timers. One tracker per window, owned by the window.

## Scope

Roughly: one main-process module (window + tracker + lifecycle), one IPC
channel for the drag, one renderer route for the card, copy in both
locales, plus Stage 2's locator binary and its build/signing step.
`apps/desktop/src/main/computer-use/cursor-overlay-window.ts` already
does transparent / always-on-top / all-workspaces / `showInactive` and
is the right thing to model the window on — possibly to generalise.

This is its own PR, separate from any settings-control work.
