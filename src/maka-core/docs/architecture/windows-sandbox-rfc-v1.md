# Windows sandbox backend RFC v1

- Status: implementation baseline selected; first preview slice ([#2961](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/pull/2961)) merged 2026-08-17; product integration continuing under release validation (preview scope in §6.5)
- Tracking: Windows Phase 4 in [issue #2142](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/issues/2142)
- Updated: 2026-08-18
- Owners: `@maka/runtime` sandbox boundary and Runtime Host execution composition
- Chinese version: [windows-sandbox-rfc-v1.zh-CN.md](./windows-sandbox-rfc-v1.zh-CN.md)

## 1. Scope and design status

This RFC defines the threat model, selected native architecture, alternatives, delivery slices, and
release evidence for the Windows sandbox. It is the complete Phase 4 security baseline. The first
product implementation is in #2961; the broader Windows support declaration remains governed by
#2142 and the release gates below.

W0 selected a Maka-owned Rust implementation rather than importing another product's setup and
protocol model. Windows 2025 evidence rejected the current-user restricted-token candidate because
real `cmd.exe` and launcher children could not initialize reliably. It selected AppContainer because
the same runner proved default denial, admitted-root access, network denial, and atomic Job
membership without elevation.

The selected first slice uses a fresh request-derived AppContainer SID, per-launch ACL grants
recorded in a durable one-shot ledger, and an AppContainer token with no network capabilities.
Stale grants are reconciled before the next launch, but their identities are never reused. It does
not claim resistance to an administrator, a compromised same-user
host process, arbitrary power loss, or every adversarial path form listed in section 10.

## 2. Research basis

The design was checked against primary sources on 2026-08-13. Repository observations are pinned
to the reviewed commits so later upstream changes cannot silently rewrite this rationale.

This is a representative, not exhaustive, survey. Projects were selected because they either ship
an agent-oriented native Windows sandbox (Codex and Gemini CLI), define a mature Windows process
sandbox (Chromium), or document a widely used agent's Windows isolation boundary (Claude Code and
OpenCode). Projects without a public implementation or an explicit Windows contract are not treated
as evidence. W0 must repeat the comparison if a materially stronger maintained implementation is
identified before the architecture freezes.

| Source | Reviewed evidence | What Maka takes from it | What Maka does not assume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Windows APIs | AppContainer isolation, restricted tokens, process attribute lists, Job Objects, Windows Sandbox, WSL2 | Kernel primitives and their documented boundaries | An API existing is not capability proof |
| OpenAI Codex `902bd9e06b3e` | `windows-sandbox-rs`, setup, ACL state, private desktop, restricted token, Job Object, firewall/WFP, smoke tests | Closest agent-specific reference: dedicated offline/online identities, persistent state reconciliation, explicit handle/job assignment, fail-closed policy checks | Direct source reuse, full contract equivalence, or correctness of unreviewed code |
| Gemini CLI `1ac337739586` | `WindowsSandboxManager.ts`, `GeminiSandbox.cs`, sandbox docs | Environment scrubbing, restricted-token launch, suspended Job assignment, explicit documentation of persistent low-integrity labels | Its network throttle or best-effort ACL behavior is sufficient for Maka |
| Chromium `024a2d21125b` | Windows broker/target design, restricted token, Job, alternate desktop, integrity levels, mitigations, AppContainer support | Layered defense, explicit broker boundary, private desktop, handle allowlist, process mitigations | Browser renderer policy can be copied unchanged to arbitrary developer tools |
| Claude Code public docs and `992381936817` examples | filesystem/network sandbox contract, proxy controls, escalation flow; Windows uses WSL2 | Separate filesystem and network guarantees; never infer native support from a generic sandbox setting | Closed-source implementation details |
| OpenCode `cc4b45612974` | official Windows documentation recommends WSL | WSL is a viable explicit external environment | WSL provides Maka's native Windows backend |

Codex, Gemini, and Chromium materially informed the layered broker, Job, ACL recovery, and
fail-closed contracts. Maka did not copy their product protocols. Executable evidence overruled the
initial dedicated-account recommendation: AppContainer is the selected identity for the first
native backend, while the dedicated restricted-token candidate remains documented negative evidence.

## 3. Decision

Maka packages a small native Rust broker/client. Runtime Host compiles `PermissionProfile` into a
closed launch manifest and invokes a one-shot broker lifecycle. The trusted native process binds the
request to its kernel-reported pipe client PID, a single-use nonce, and a SHA-256 digest of the exact
launch policy, then launches the target with layered Windows controls:

- an AppContainer primary token with no network capabilities;
- a Job Object attached atomically through `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_JOB_LIST` and configured to kill
  the tree on close;
- handle inheritance disabled;
- AppContainer ACEs for only the compiled read/write roots, with a persisted recovery ledger;
- recursive reparse-point rejection before ACL mutation;
- a closed, sorted environment from the normalized command;
- bounded local named-pipe framing protected to SYSTEM and the current user.

The packaged x64 backend is registered only when the native resource exists. Missing binaries,
invalid paths, unsupported profiles, malformed manifests, failed ACL recovery, or launch failures
remain typed fail-closed outcomes; there is no unsandboxed retry. The same backend is available to
the filesystem worker and Agent command execution through the existing `SandboxManager` path.

Windows Sandbox and WSL2 may later be exposed as explicit external profiles. They are not substitutes
for the native per-command backend. AppContainer alone is insufficient; the Job, ACL policy,
recovery ledger, broker authorization, and fail-closed Runtime integration are part of the boundary.

## 4. Existing Maka contract

The platform-neutral authorities remain `PermissionProfile` and the active session
`ExecutionBoundary`. Windows consumes the same normalized command and path context as macOS Seatbelt
and Linux bubblewrap; it must not introduce a second permission language.

- `SandboxManager` selects a backend and transforms a command; it never retries unsandboxed.
- The caller owns canonical cwd, workspace roots, runtime roots, and boundary expansion approval.
- The backend owns profile compilation, enforceability checks, and a typed launch request.
- The process runner owns launch, cancellation, output collection, and lifecycle settlement.
- Runtime Host owns composition and refuses managed I/O when the backend is unavailable.

Windows cannot be represented honestly as an argv wrapper. Token creation, logon identity selection,
handle filtering, private desktop selection, and atomic Job assignment require a typed native launch
request in `SandboxExecRequest`.

## 5. Threat model

The attacker controls command arguments, scripts, child processes, filesystem contents inside
approved roots, and data parsed by sandboxed helpers. Protected assets include:

- files outside approved roots and protected metadata inside writable roots;
- host credentials, environment secrets, registry data, DPAPI material, and user profiles;
- host network access, loopback services, SMB/UNC channels, and inherited sockets;
- processes, windows, handles, devices, and IPC objects outside the sandbox boundary;
- Maka's sandbox setup records, ACL ownership ledger, executable, and broker protocol.

The Windows kernel, signed Maka binaries, Runtime Host, and the parent user session are trusted. The
boundary does not defend against an administrator, kernel compromise, or an already-compromised
same-user process outside Maka. Sandboxed code is treated as malicious after its first instruction.

Paths are hostile. Reparse points, junctions, symlinks, hard links, alternate data streams, device
paths, UNC paths, case aliases, 8.3 names, mount points, and replacement races must not widen access.
Lexical prefix checks are never authorization evidence.

## 6. Required guarantees

### 6.1 Filesystem

- Default deny: no read or write outside roots admitted by the exact profile.
- Read and write grants remain distinct.
- `.git`, `.agents`, and `.codex` deny-write applies at every nested occurrence unless an exact
  platform-neutral grant overrides it.
- Runtime and executable roots are minimal and read-only.
- Per-invocation temporary storage is removed only after the process tree drains.
- NTFS/ReFS are capability-probed; filesystems that cannot enforce the required descriptors fail
  closed. FAT-family volumes are not supported for restricted profiles.
- Maka-owned ACL changes are attributed to a unique per-launch principal, record their actual
  recursive/exact grant mode in a versioned state file, and are reconciled at startup.
- Setup, upgrade, uninstall, or a changed profile cannot leave an unknown usable grant. Corrupt or
  missing ownership state fails readiness rather than guessing which ACE is safe to remove.
- Canonical target and lexical alias are both considered when a reparse point exists.

### 6.2 Network

- `network.restricted` cannot create outbound or inbound network channels.
- Denial covers TCP, UDP, DNS, loopback, listeners, SMB/UNC, and inherited sockets.
- Named pipes are denied by default. The packaged one-shot path performs authorization in-process;
  the standalone experimental broker pipe has a DACL that admits only the
  selected sandbox principal and broker.
- If Windows reports that local firewall policy is ineffective, partially applied, or overridden by
  group policy, the offline backend is unavailable.
- Future domain allowlists must use a Maka-owned proxy; they must not compile DNS answers into a
  durable direct-address allowlist.

### 6.3 Process, desktop, handles, and environment

- The child is placed in the Job Object through `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_JOB_LIST` at creation time;
  there is no runnable pre-assignment window.
- The Job kills all descendants when its owner closes and does not permit breakaway.
- Only declared stdio/protocol handles are inherited through `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST`.
- Non-interactive workers start on a launcher-created private (alternate) desktop, never the
  interactive `Default` desktop; keeping a worker *unable* to enumerate, message, or hook the user's
  interactive windows even after in-process escape attempts additionally requires the deferred
  no-Win32k/window-station gates (§6.5). _(Enforced as initial-desktop **placement**, not
  escape-proof confinement: each launch and the readiness probe
  create a per-launch alternate desktop whose DACL grants only the launching user, Local System, and
  that launch's AppContainer SID — granting the AppContainer SID only the minimal non-interactive
  rights, and leading with a deny ACE that strips `DESKTOP_SWITCHDESKTOP`, `DESKTOP_HOOKCONTROL`, and
  the journal-record/playback rights from the launching-user SID, because the AppContainer child's
  token still carries that SID as an effective SID and would otherwise be named a grantee of those
  rights by the owner's full-control ACE.
  The child is started with `STARTUPINFOW.lpDesktop` set to it, and fails closed if the desktop cannot
  be created or the SID cannot be granted. `lpDesktop` selects only the child's *initial* desktop, so
  this places the worker off the interactive `Default` desktop and DACL-protects the private one — it
  does **not** structurally prevent in-process code from calling `OpenDesktopW("Default")` +
  `SetThreadDesktop` to re-attach, because no no-Win32k mitigation, dedicated window station, or token
  boundary is enforced yet. It also does **not** isolate the clipboard, which belongs to the window
  station both desktops still share. The desktop carries an explicit Low no-write-up mandatory label
  (`S:(ML;;NW;;;LW)`) so the DACL's create-window/write grants pass Mandatory Integrity Control for
  the Low-IL AppContainer child, and its heap is bounded per launch via `CreateDesktopExW` so the
  supported ten-way concurrency stays an order of magnitude under the system desktop-heap limit. An
  escape-proof boundary (a no-Win32k process mitigation, a dedicated window station isolating the
  clipboard, and an in-child window-creation check proving the granted rights end to end) remains a
  later hardening gate — see §6.5.)_
- The token removes privileges and uses restricting SIDs; low integrity is defense in depth, not the
  filesystem policy by itself.
- The child receives an allowlisted environment. Credentials, tokens, proxy variables, shell startup
  hooks, user-specific executable search paths, and loader injection variables are not inherited.
- Elevation, service creation, scheduled tasks, COM activation outside an explicit allowlist, shell
  association launch, debugger attach, and parent-token/process-handle access are denied.
- Supported process mitigations are selected explicitly and compatibility-tested with Node,
  PowerShell, cmd, Git, and packaged Electron resources before W2.

### 6.4 Capability and failure

- Readiness launches a real probe under the production identity, token, Job, desktop, handles,
  filesystem policy, and offline network policy. OS version checks alone are insufficient.
  _(Implemented: the preview's `--readiness-probe` stands up the real AppContainer identity and
  token, a kill-on-close Job, and a per-launch private desktop, then launches a throwaway confined
  child on that desktop, failing closed if the host cannot create or enforce the boundary rather
  than trusting file presence alone. The full per-profile filesystem policy and offline-network
  policy are not yet exercised at readiness — see §6.5.)_
- The readiness probe's throwaway profile lifecycle is isolated and fail-closed. _(Implemented: the
  probe profile lives under a dedicated `maka.readiness.` namespace that is structurally disjoint
  from the production `maka.sandbox.` namespace, and its reserved `requestId` is rejected by launch
  validation, so no production launch can ever resolve to the profile the probe deletes and
  recreates. The whole delete→create→probe→settle→drop cycle is serialized across processes by a
  DACL-hardened per-user named mutex — the same primitive the ACL ledger uses — so concurrent probes
  cannot delete each other's live registration. When the probe cannot prove its Job drained it fails
  closed (reports unavailable) for that cycle; the fixed readiness identity is not durably
  quarantined — cleanup relies on the kill-on-close Job's tree termination, and because the probe
  grants zero filesystem roots a surviving child inherits no ACE authority. On the consumer side a
  negative availability result is cached only for a bounded TTL, which bounds how long one transient
  failure poisons the module cache: the *next composition build* re-probes. It is not a running-host
  retry — the filesystem worker is published once when a composition is built, so a host that already
  resolved availability negative recovers only on a new composition or a Runtime Host restart; a
  positive result is cached for the process lifetime. Durable quarantine of an unsettled identity and
  active running-host readiness recovery are deferred gates — see §6.5.)_
- Launcher signature, version, and digest are verified against packaged metadata. _(Later gate: the
  per-launch request digest is recomputed and enforced in-broker today; verifying the launcher
  binary's signature and version against packaged metadata is deferred with Phase 3 signing — see
  §6.5.)_
- Missing setup, identity drift, ACL-state corruption, ineffective network policy, unsupported
  filesystem, helper mismatch, or a failed probe returns a stable typed unavailable reason. _(Later
  gate: the readiness probe today collapses every failure to a single fail-closed boolean surfaced as
  `backend_not_available`; the structured typed reasons are deferred — see §6.5.)_
- `auto` and `require` never fall back to host execution for a restricted managed profile.
- Diagnostics expose the backend, setup version, and failure stage without paths, SIDs, credentials,
  environment values, or firewall details. _(Later gate: the probe runs with `stdio: 'ignore'` and
  retains only the exit result, so setup version and failure stage are not yet propagated — deferred
  with the structured unavailable reasons, see §6.5.)_

### 6.5 Preview implementation status (2026-08-24)

The first product slice — the packaged Windows 11 x64 AppContainer backend in
[#2961](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/pull/2961), merged 2026-08-17 — enforces a subset
of the guarantees above. This subsection aligns the documented guarantees with what the code
actually ships so the RFC does not overclaim. Bullets tagged with a follow-up PR number
(`(#3161)` readiness probe, `(#3174)` private-desktop placement) land in that PR rather than the
merged #2961 slice; the untagged bullets are enforced by #2961 today. The remaining guarantees are
designed but explicitly deferred as later gates, tracked by Phase 4 in
[#2142](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/issues/2142).

Enforced (merged in #2961 unless tagged with a follow-up PR):

- default-deny filesystem with distinct read/write roots compiled from the exact profile (§6.1);
- recursive reparse-point rejection and multi-hard-link rejection before ACL mutation (§5, §6.1);
- a fresh request-derived AppContainer SID, per-launch ACL grants in a versioned recovery ledger,
  and stale-ledger reconciliation at startup (§6.1, §7.1);
- an AppContainer token with no network capabilities (§6.2);
- atomic kill-on-close Job membership through `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_JOB_LIST` (§6.3);
- inheritance limited to declared stdio/protocol handles through `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST`
  (§6.3);
- a closed, sorted, allowlisted environment (§6.3);
- a kernel-observed Runtime Host owner handle on the packaged one-shot broker: owner exit interrupts
  the first launch, terminates and drains the AppContainer Job, and releases the launch ledger/ACEs;
- a packaged 64-launch repeated-wave concurrency soak with disjoint launch identities, followed by
  process and ACL-ledger residue assertions;
- a packaged malicious-child matrix covering recursive junction and multi-hard-link admission,
  outside-file access, TCP connection denial, host named-pipe access, ambient environment,
  host HKCU values, parent-token access, descendant AppContainer/Job inheritance, and quarantined
  identity non-reuse;
- per-launch private-desktop **placement** (§6.3) **(#3174)**: each production launch and the readiness probe
  create an alternate desktop on the current window station whose DACL grants only the launching user,
  Local System, and that launch's AppContainer SID — the SID getting only minimal non-interactive
  rights, and a leading deny ACE stripping `DESKTOP_SWITCHDESKTOP`, `DESKTOP_HOOKCONTROL`, and journal
  record/playback from the launching-user SID the AppContainer child effectively carries — and start
  the child with `STARTUPINFOW.lpDesktop` pointing at it, failing closed if it cannot be created or
  granted. The desktop is pinned at Low integrity (`S:(ML;;NW;;;LW)`) so the granted rights pass MIC
  for the Low-IL child, and its heap is bounded per launch (`CreateDesktopExW`, 512 KiB) so supported
  concurrency cannot exhaust the system desktop heap. Because `lpDesktop` selects only the *initial*
  desktop, this places the worker off the interactive `Default` desktop and DACL-protects the private
  one; it is placement plus DACL protection, **not** an escape-proof boundary — nothing structurally
  stops in-process code from `OpenDesktopW("Default")` + `SetThreadDesktop`, and the clipboard is
  window-station-scoped and remains shared (a no-Win32k mitigation, a dedicated window station, and a
  token boundary are deferred gates below);
- a production-identity readiness probe (§6.4) **(#3161)**: `--readiness-probe` stands up the real
  AppContainer identity and token, a kill-on-close Job, and the private desktop, then launches a
  throwaway confined child on that desktop (`cmd.exe /d /c exit 0`, with AutoRun disabled so a host's
  shell customization cannot skew the result), so availability fails closed on hosts where the OS
  cannot create the boundary rather than on the packaged binary's presence alone; on success it emits
  a machine-readable attestation of the verified facts (exact-SID match, specific-Job membership,
  settlement, private-desktop placement) that the release smoke asserts field by field, so the gate
  cannot silently degrade into a hollow exit-0 check;
- a dedicated, cross-process-serialized readiness profile lifecycle (§6.4) **(#3161)**: the probe profile lives
  in a namespace disjoint from production, its reserved `requestId` is rejected by validation, a
  DACL-hardened per-user named mutex serializes its delete→create→probe→drop cycle, an unsettled
  probe fails closed rather than claiming a clean boundary (relying on the kill-on-close Job and a
  zero-authority identity for cleanup, not durable quarantine), and negative availability is cached
  with a bounded TTL so one transient failure does not poison the module cache past that window — the
  next composition build re-probes, rather than the running host recovering in place;
- fail-closed capability outcomes with no unsandboxed fallback for `auto`/`require` (§6.4).

Designed but deferred as later gates (not enforced in the preview slice):

- Full window-station separation and clipboard isolation (§6.3). The worker runs on a private
  alternate desktop, but that desktop still lives on the launcher's window station rather than a
  dedicated one. Because the clipboard is window-station-scoped, it is not isolated by the alternate
  desktop; moving to a dedicated window station (and thereby isolating the clipboard) is a later
  hardening gate.
- Escape-proof desktop confinement: no-Win32k mitigation, token boundary, and end-to-end Low-IL
  desktop rights (§6.3). `STARTUPINFOW.lpDesktop` selects only the initial desktop, so absent a
  no-Win32k process mitigation (or a separate window-station/token boundary) in-process code can
  `OpenDesktopW("Default")` + `SetThreadDesktop` to re-attach to the interactive desktop; the shipped
  contract is initial-desktop placement plus DACL protection, not structural confinement. Separately,
  the desktop now carries an explicit Low no-write-up mandatory label so the AppContainer SID's
  create-window/write grants pass MIC, but no probe creates a window in-child, so those rights are
  labeled-usable rather than proven end to end. Enforcing a no-Win32k mitigation, plus a child-side
  window-creation test, is deferred.
- Full-policy readiness coverage (§6.4). The readiness probe already stands up the production
  AppContainer identity, token, kill-on-close Job, and private desktop and launches a confined child
  on it, but it does not yet compile and exercise the exact per-profile filesystem roots or the
  offline-network policy at readiness; those are enforced per launch rather than re-proven at
  readiness.
- Launcher signature/version verification at readiness (§6.4). The per-launch request digest is
  recomputed and enforced in-broker on every launch; verifying the launcher binary's Authenticode
  signature and version against packaged metadata is deferred together with Phase 3 signing.
- Structured unavailable reasons and diagnostics (§6.4). The readiness probe fails closed as a single
  boolean surfaced as `backend_not_available`; the stable typed unavailable reasons and the
  setup-version/failure-stage diagnostics are designed but not yet implemented or propagated.
- Concurrent real-machine readiness race coverage (§6.4). The readiness profile lifecycle is
  serialized by a named mutex and covered by unit tests over the mutex-name, namespace, and
  validation primitives; a multi-process race test that spawns real concurrent probes on a live
  Windows host is deferred as disproportionate for a throwaway diagnostic probe and inherently flaky
  in CI. The serialization primitive itself, not an end-to-end race harness, is the enforced contract.
- Durable quarantine of an unsettled readiness identity (§6.4). When a probe cannot prove its Job
  drained it fails closed for that cycle, and the next probe deletes and recreates the fixed
  identity under the lease. Residual risk is bounded — the readiness child is `cmd.exe /c exit 0`
  granted zero filesystem roots, so a hypothetically-surviving child spawns nothing and inherits no
  ACE authority, and the kill-on-close Job terminates the tree — but the identity is not durably
  quarantined. Durable quarantine (or unique per-probe identities plus an orphan/reconciliation
  ledger) is deferred.
- Active running-host readiness recovery (§6.4). A negative availability result is bounded by a TTL
  so it does not poison the module cache past that window, and the *next composition build* re-probes.
  A running Runtime Host does not actively re-probe or hot-publish the filesystem worker — the worker
  is composed once when a candidate is built — so recovery from a transient negative in an
  already-running host is scoped to a new composition build or a restart. An active readiness
  retry with dynamic worker publication is deferred.
- Direct Windows Credential Manager/DPAPI isolation evidence. The packaged W1 matrix proves that
  ambient credential files and environment secrets are not granted or inherited, but direct
  `CredRead`/DPAPI probes remain a W2/W3 hardening gate.
- Inbound listener enforcement. AppContainer denies the packaged outbound TCP/UDP attempts, but
  local listener creation is not itself denied by the current token policy; full inbound-channel
  enforcement remains a W2/W3 network hardening gate.
- UDP channel enforcement. The W1 matrix proves outbound TCP denial; UDP send/response and DNS/SMB
  enforcement remain a W2/W3 network hardening gate rather than a vacuous bind-only claim.

Deferral narrows readiness richness and desktop-layer defense-in-depth, not the enforcement
boundary: an unavailable, drifted, or failed backend still fails closed, and a restricted managed
profile never falls back to host execution. The lifecycle evidence for cancellation, parent-death,
concurrency, process-drain, and residual ACL/state release tracked by W1 (§9) and Phase 4 (#2142)
remains release evidence, not an assumption.

### 7.1 Setup and durable state

The first implementation needs no elevated setup. Windows creates a request-derived Maka
AppContainer profile, and the packaged native binary grants its unique SID only the roots admitted
for the current launch. Before mutation it recursively rejects `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT`, persists a
versioned ledger with `create_new` and `sync_all`, and reconciles every stale ledger before accepting
a new request. A global kernel mutex covers only ledger/ACL mutation; each launch holds a separate
request-specific kernel lease through child settlement, so recovery skips live ledgers while disjoint
launches execute concurrently. Normal settlement removes the SID ACE and then deletes the ledger.

The ledger filename is a SHA-256 of the request identity, so request-controlled path characters
cannot escape its directory. `icacls.exe` is resolved from absolute `%SystemRoot%\System32`, invoked
without a shell, and uses `/L` so link objects are operated on rather than followed. The Windows CI
smoke proves normal cleanup, stale-ledger recovery, and rejection of a junction in an admitted tree.
Crash/power-loss and concurrent replacement hardening remain release evidence, not assumptions.

### 7.2 Broker and protocol

The native component is not a resident privileged service. The packaged `--broker-local` path
consumes and deletes one manifest, binds it to its kernel process PID, authorizes it in-process, and
exits after the AppContainer process settles and ACLs are restored. The standalone named-pipe modes
remain transport evidence and are not traversed by the packaged path.

Authorization recomputes the digest
from the complete canonical launch object, so changing executable, arguments, cwd, roots, network,
or environment invalidates approval. Unknown fields, versions, outcomes, or oversized frames fail
closed. The authorized path can call only the AppContainer atomic launcher.

## 8. Alternatives and project comparison

| Option | Evidence | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated sandbox identities + restricted token + Job + private desktop + ACL ledger + WFP/firewall | Codex demonstrates this agent-oriented shape, including setup and adversarial tests | Reference for future stronger tiers; runner evidence showed the Maka candidate could not reliably initialize real children |
| AppContainer + atomic Job + one-shot broker + ACL ledger | Microsoft and Chromium document the primitives; Maka Windows 2025 CI proves the composed boundary | Selected for the native backend |
| Current-user restricted token + Job | Useful process hardening | Rejected: existing user ACLs remain readable and the prototype did not initialize reliably |
| Low integrity ACL + Job | Gemini implements this lightweight path | Rejected for Maka's strong tier: persistent labels, best-effort ACL failures, and network throttling do not meet fail-closed policy |
| Chromium sandbox library | Mature broker/target, hooks, mitigations, AppContainer support | Reference only: large C++ integration and renderer assumptions do not match one-shot arbitrary tools |
| Windows Sandbox | Strong VM boundary | Future external profile: optional feature and coarse per-command lifecycle |
| WSL2 | Used/recommended by Claude Code and OpenCode for Windows workflows | Future external profile; not native Windows semantics |
| Docker/Hyper-V container | Stronger environment boundary when available | Optional external profile, not a universal native prerequisite |

## 9. Delivery plan and gates

### W0: feasibility and frozen implementation spec

- [x] build a Maka-owned Rust launcher with reproducible MSVC CI;
- [x] compare restricted-token and AppContainer identities with real child evidence;
- [x] prove atomic Job assignment, no inherited handles, and live loopback denial;
- [x] define closed broker, launch, and ACL-ledger schemas;
- [x] select the AppContainer implementation and document the rejected candidate;
- [x] update this RFC with the selected sequence and failure boundary.

### W1: managed read-only filesystem worker

- [x] compile admitted roots and runtime/executable roots from `PermissionProfile`;
- [x] deny ambient filesystem and network access under AppContainer;
- [x] compose capability detection into Runtime Host managed execution;
- [x] package and verify the x64 native resource;
- [x] fail closed when the resource or capability is unavailable;
- [x] finish cancellation, parent-death, concurrency, and residual-state release tests through the
  packaged `FilesystemWorkerClient`/broker path.

This is the first user-visible sandbox milestone. Remaining unchecked evidence limits the support
claim; it does not permit an unsandboxed fallback.

### W2: workspace-write and general commands

- enforce write roots and nested protected metadata;
- support exact executable discovery without ambient PATH/startup scripts;
- prove PowerShell, cmd, Git, native executables, ConPTY, and descendants;
- integrate setup, upgrade, rollback, uninstall, and signed packaging;
- preserve path-free run-trace enforcement evidence.

### W3: adversarial review and support declaration

- run the release-blocking matrix on all supported Windows versions/filesystems;
- complete independent security review and resolve every high/critical finding;
- document unsupported environments and recovery;
- only then mark Phase 4 complete or advertise restricted profiles as supported.

The packaged W1 matrix is release-blocking and machine-readable. It closes the executable evidence
for the currently shipped filesystem-worker surface, not the wider W2 general-command claim.
Authenticode identity, direct Credential Manager/DPAPI probes, no-Win32k, dedicated window-station
and clipboard isolation, and power-loss automatic recovery remain explicit later gates. Independent
human security review remains mandatory even when every automated row is green.

## 10. Required release evidence

The Windows sandbox job must execute positive and negative child-process tests for:

- allowed-root read/write and denied outside/read-only/protected-metadata access;
- junction, symlink, mount point, hard link, 8.3 alias, case alias, ADS, UNC, device-path, and
  replacement-race escape;
- TCP/UDP/DNS/loopback/listener/SMB/named-pipe/inherited-socket escape;
- child/grandchild, detached process, breakaway, shell association, COM, scheduled task, and service;
- environment, registry, credential store, DPAPI, parent process/token, clipboard, and user profile;
- normal exit, timeout, cancellation, launcher crash, Runtime Host crash, desktop crash, and reboot;
- concurrent sandboxes with disjoint identities and roots;
- every durable setup, ACL, firewall/WFP, and marker publication failpoint;
- installer/upgrade/uninstall verification of the exact signed launcher and complete state cleanup.

For the W1 preview, the packaged verifier maps the supported attack surface to executable evidence:

| Category | Packaged evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Filesystem aliases | outside denial plus recursive junction and multi-hard-link admission refusal |
| Network channels | TCP connect denial without network capabilities |
| IPC | host named-pipe denial and an explicit inherited-handle list |
| Descendants | child creation is denied fail-closed, or a created descendant retains the AppContainer token and kill-on-close Job |
| Environment/credentials | ambient host secret and outside credential file are unavailable |
| Registry/parent | host HKCU value and parent process token are unavailable |
| Lifecycle | timeout, cancellation, Runtime Host death, broker death, 64-launch soak, quarantine non-reuse |

Rows that require a feature the W1 preview does not expose remain fail-closed and explicitly deferred
above; they are not counted as passing evidence for a broader shell/general-command tier.

Generated flags and unit tests are necessary but are not security evidence. A passing test must show
that the denied operation fails in a real child and that no process or unknown durable authorization
remains.

## 11. Estimate and completion criteria

For one experienced engineer, after RFC review:

- W0: 1-2 weeks;
- W1: 2-3 weeks;
- W2: 3-5 weeks;
- W3 and remediation: 1-2 weeks.

The realistic Phase 4 range is 7-12 weeks, not including external review scheduling. Two engineers
can overlap native setup/launcher work with Runtime integration and test harnesses, but the security
review and architecture gates remain sequential. The read-only W1 milestone can land in roughly
3-5 weeks if W0 confirms the Codex-shaped approach and packaging toolchain.

Phase 4 is complete only when W0-W3 evidence is release-blocking, setup and uninstall recover cleanly,
restricted profiles never silently degrade, and the security review has no unresolved high or
critical findings.
