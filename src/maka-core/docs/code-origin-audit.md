# Code origin audit

**Historical scan baseline:** `1518442865763d603571f5d77c13ffc3b0c96125` (2026-08-11)
**Evidence reconstruction:** 2026-08-12
**Report status:** complete for the recovered scan results; bootstrap tooling confirmation remains open

## Outcome

The recovered historical scan surfaced no GPL, AGPL, commercial, or unknown-license candidate. One candidate is source-available (entry 23, `MIT + Commons Clause`); it was examined separately and Maka takes no material from it. Of 417 files with SCANOSS results, 392 matched Maka repositories and 25 matched other projects. Manual review classified 22 of the 25 external candidates as common or structurally necessary short code and three as real third-party lineage with an incorrect or incomplete scanner attribution:

- the generated Astryx theme and ejected Astryx `ChatReasoning` component are MIT-licensed Meta material;
- Maka's model protocol types are adapted from the Apache-2.0 AI SDK packages `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` and `@ai-sdk/provider`, not from the `talkio` package selected by the scanner.

This audit adds Astryx and the AI SDK adaptation to the top-level `LICENSE`. `NOTICE` does not change: the fixed Astryx and AI SDK sources contain no upstream `NOTICE`, and their license notices are carried in `LICENSE` or in the source file. The 22 incidental matches do not add third-party material or attribution obligations.

This is bounded evidence, not proof that every line is original. Results depend on the fixed source snapshot, SCANOSS knowledge base, scanner thresholds, supported file types, and human classification.

## Scope and tools

The baseline contains 2,545 tracked files. The historical investigation used:

| Tool | Version | Scope | Data behavior | Preserved result |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| ScanCode Toolkit | 32.5.0 | 2,542 tracked files; local license, copyright, and package analysis | Local only | The raw result expired; the contemporaneous count and conclusion are retained here |
| SCANOSS JS CLI | 0.40.2 | 2,231 files supported by its winnowing scanner | The public API received winnowing fingerprints with obfuscated file identifiers; it did not receive source files or repository-relative paths | The 2,231-file JSON and WFP were recovered locally and used to reconstruct the table below |
| FOSSA CLI | 3.17.16 (`d693e0d6f44d`) | Static npm dependency analysis | Local static mode; no FOSSA project or cloud snippet scan | One npm project succeeded with no analysis warning |

The SCANOSS response identifies server `5.4.25` and knowledge bases `26.07` (monthly) and `26.08.10` (daily). Markdown, images, and other unsupported formats did not receive SCANOSS fingerprints. They were handled separately under [Other provenance evidence](#other-provenance-evidence).

The recovered JSON and WFP were working files and were not retained; they are not present on the machine that produced this report, and no hash or byte size of them was recorded before they were lost. This table therefore cannot be verified byte-for-byte against the artifacts it came from. What can be re-checked independently is each conclusion: every row names the upstream candidate, and the rows that drive a `LICENSE` or `NOTICE` decision carry their own reproduction path — see [Model protocol adaptation](#model-protocol-adaptation) for entry 17 and the git revisions cited in entry 23. A future scan should write its JSON and WFP to a retained location and record their SHA-256 and size in the report before any conclusion depends on them.

No new fingerprint or source upload was performed while reconstructing this report.

### Reproduction

The original shell transcript was not retained. The following commands reconstruct the fixed snapshot and the scanner configuration represented by the recovered artifacts; a new API response can differ as the knowledge base changes:

```sh
AUDIT_SNAPSHOT="$(mktemp -d)"
git archive 1518442865763d603571f5d77c13ffc3b0c96125 | tar -x -C "$AUDIT_SNAPSHOT"
npx --yes --package scanoss@0.40.2 scanoss-js wfp --obfuscate -o scan.wfp "$AUDIT_SNAPSHOT"
npx --yes --package scanoss@0.40.2 scanoss-js scan --wfp --obfuscate -o result.json scan.wfp
```

The final command sends fingerprints to the CLI's public default endpoint. Obtain project approval before running it. To reproduce only the local fingerprint set, stop after the `wfp` command. Compare results by source content hash rather than obfuscated filename because each obfuscated run may assign different identifiers.

The FOSSA run was constrained to static analysis. It detected the npm project successfully, but it did not perform snippet provenance analysis and therefore does not corroborate or replace the SCANOSS results.

## SCANOSS result reconstruction

The recovered result has 2,231 keys:

- 1,814 returned no match;
- 367 matched `maka-agent/maka-agent`;
- 25 matched `jackwener/maka-agent`, a Maka fork;
- 25 matched projects outside Maka.

The WFP records the MD5 content hash and an obfuscated filename for every scanned file. Hashing the fixed Git snapshot mapped all 2,231 identifiers back to exactly one repository path; no key was unmapped. The table records the scanner's best candidate. “Common snippet” means that the matched text is a routine API shape, type declaration, test scaffold, or build boilerplate and that the candidate does not explain the local file's provenance. A percentage is the scanner's reported coverage, not an authorship probability.

Several rows note that the matched file is absent from current `main`. That is a supplementary fact, not a disposition: the repository history is published too, so each row is classified on the matched text itself rather than on whether the file survives in the release snapshot. Candidate license fields are the scanner's, and entry 23 shows they can be wrong; any candidate whose license affects a `LICENSE` or `NOTICE` conclusion was re-checked against the upstream license file.

## Model protocol adaptation

Entry 17 was re-examined directly against upstream source rather than against the scanner candidate. The finding is that `packages/runtime/src/model-protocol.ts` adapts AI SDK material and that the first revision of this report overstated what the file itself disclosed: the file's header claimed only that its shapes were "structurally equivalent" and "Maka-owned", and named neither a source version nor the adaptation.

The adaptation is established by more than shape equivalence:

- The `ProviderReference` doc comment reproduces the upstream `SharedV4ProviderReference` comment near-verbatim, including its explanation of the `type?: never` constraint and its two examples, with only the type name changed.
- `JSONValue`, `JSONObject`, and `JSONArray` match upstream exactly, including the union order and the `| undefined` index signature.
- Field order matches upstream member for member, including an upstream inconsistency: `FilePart` orders `data, filename, mediaType` while the tool-result `file` variant orders `data, mediaType, filename`. Both orderings are reproduced.
- Union member order matches, including arbitrary sequences such as `CustomPart` appearing second in `AssistantContent`.
- The upstream choice of `interface` versus `type` is reproduced per declaration. `ToolApprovalRequest` and `ToolApprovalResponse` are the only content-part shapes declared as `type` in the Maka file, matching upstream.

Maka's modifications are the removal of the deprecated `file-*` and `image-*` tool-result content variants, extraction of the inline tool-result content union into `ToolResultContentPart`, inlining of the shared provider aliases, and declaration of the role message shapes as interfaces. Roughly 170 of the file's 418 lines — the tool definition, usage, finish reason, failure, request metadata, and stream contracts — are Maka-authored with no upstream counterpart.

The material spans two packages. `JSONValue` and the `SharedV4` provider option, provider reference, and file data shapes come from `@ai-sdk/provider`, not from `@ai-sdk/provider-utils`. The first revision of this report named only `provider-utils`; `LICENSE` now names both.

The versions pinned in `LICENSE` are those installed when the adaptation was made in `3249f2a0ec2b389efcd935078c6c835c31195e88` (#1381 slice 1, 2026-07-23): `@ai-sdk/provider-utils@5.0.11` and `@ai-sdk/provider@4.0.3`. The audit baseline snapshot resolved `5.0.25` and `4.0.7`; every adapted declaration is byte-identical across those version ranges, so the two pinnings identify the same source material. Reproduce with:

```sh
npm pack @ai-sdk/provider-utils@5.0.11 @ai-sdk/provider@4.0.3
```

and compare `package/src/types/`, `package/src/json-value/`, and `package/src/shared/v4/` against the module.

The file now carries the Apache-2.0 §4(b) modification notice that this lineage requires. Adding the component to `LICENSE` alone did not satisfy that obligation.

## LICENSE and NOTICE review

The top-level `LICENSE` now accounts for source material that is directly included or adapted in Maka:

- Apache-2.0 [`@ai-sdk/provider-utils@5.0.11`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ai-sdk/provider-utils/v/5.0.11) and [`@ai-sdk/provider@4.0.3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ai-sdk/provider/v/4.0.3), from which `packages/runtime/src/model-protocol.ts` adapts provider-boundary shapes;
- MIT Astryx at `c9fe4379e9959b9ba5eeff56def34c752223450e` for the ejected `ChatReasoning` source and `110987b4505dc44119b94bed53d92b9840088a61` for theme-neutral v0.4.0 and its generated theme material;
- MIT `trycua/cua` at `8c921b2b3bf13494724ead4f0a814d80c56a7e8b`, already recorded by pull request #2676.

The desktop binary distribution also carries generated production npm notices at `apps/desktop/resources/licenses/npm/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`, and the build checks that artifact byte-for-byte.

The audit also corrected the notice generator's version-pinned Apache override. It previously read the entire top-level `LICENSE`; once that file acquired third-party appendices, those unrelated appendices were copied into the `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` package section and the checked artifact became stale. The override now extracts only the standard Apache-2.0 portion, with a focused regression test.

No `NOTICE` addition is warranted. The fixed Astryx and `trycua/cua` revisions have no upstream `NOTICE`; neither AI SDK package has an upstream `NOTICE`; and MIT copyright notices already preserved in `LICENSE` or source should not be duplicated into `NOTICE`. This follows ASF guidance to keep `NOTICE` limited to legally required notices and to make `LICENSE`/`NOTICE` reflect only bundled bits.

## Other provenance evidence

The SCANOSS table above covers only what its winnowing scanner fingerprints, which is source code in supported formats. Additional incoming-material and same-author transfer records that sit outside that scan are recorded here. The records distinguish third-party attribution obligations from contributor-confirmed ASF contributions rather than treating every cross-repository lineage as third-party code.

### Adapted opencode source

`packages/runtime/src/tool-output.ts` and `packages/runtime/src/edit-replace.ts` each state in a header comment that they are adapted from opencode. Both statements are accurate and the adaptation is substantial:

- `truncateToolOutput` follows `truncate.output()` line for line, sharing the `2000`-line and `50 KiB` budgets, the `direction?: 'head' | 'tail'` option, the local names `out`, `bytes`, `hitBytes`, `size`, `preview`, `removed`, and `unit`, and the asymmetric newline accounting that uses `(i > 0 ? 1 : 0)` when keeping the head and `(out.length > 0 ? 1 : 0)` when keeping the tail. Maka added byte-safe single-line slicing, trailing-newline handling, and the recovery hint, and dropped the upstream spill-file machinery.
- `edit-replace.ts` reuses the escape-normalizing replacer verbatim at the level of expression: the regular expression `/\\(n|t|r|'|"|`|\\|\n|\$)/g` is character-for-character identical and its nine branches appear in the same order, rewritten from a `switch` into an `if` chain. The line-trimmed and whitespace-normalized matchers follow the same upstream structure.

Upstream is MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 opencode. The repository now resolves to `anomalyco/opencode`; the comparison used commit `fc80874`. Because opencode is not an npm dependency, `scripts/generate-third-party-notices.mjs` cannot discover it: that generator walks the npm production dependency trees of `@maka/desktop` and `maka-agent` only. The root `LICENSE` therefore records the fixed source revision, adapted files, upstream lineage, copyright, and MIT permission notice explicitly. No `NOTICE` addition is warranted because upstream ships none and the MIT attribution belongs in `LICENSE`.

### models.dev data snapshot

`packages/core/src/model-metadata.generated.ts` and `packages/runtime/src/telemetry/model-pricing.generated.ts` are build-time, untracked derivations of the committed `scripts/model-metadata/models-dev-api.snapshot.json` projection selected from `https://models.dev/api.json`. This is a two-level authority boundary: models.dev remains the upstream refresh source, while the committed snapshot is the sole build input for a particular repository revision and release. An explicit refresh imports upstream changes for review; normal installation and build paths never fetch a moving latest response. Upstream `anomalyco/models.dev` is MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 models.dev. The individual entries are facts and are not themselves copyrightable, but the selection and arrangement — which providers and fields are carried, and upstream's normalized structures such as `lifecycle` and `thinkingOptions.efforts` — come from that database. The same generator boundary applies: models.dev is not an npm dependency, so the root `LICENSE` records its source, repository, copyright, MIT permission notice, generated outputs, and snapshot provenance explicitly. The committed snapshot and generated headers bind the redistributed projection to recorded digests, making the fixed input identifiable without relying on the npm notice generator or a runtime network request.

### PawWork browser port

The embedded-browser work introduced by Maka commit `fab537af179232cc88dc39314038000f70d15d05` was ported from two fixed source batches in [`Astro-Han/pawwork`](https://github.com/Astro-Han/pawwork):

- CDP bridge and browser options: `aff7ce202f5ccb9a7166a95172aa754b0d4de7db`;
- `BrowserSession`, generic observe→act tools, and their desktop integration: `e3595b705c687c369828736ecd154127ed44f545`.

Both PawWork snapshots are Apache-2.0. On 2026-08-23, their author AstroHan confirmed that these are the only two source batches, that all code carried into Maka was his own work, and that he submitted it directly as an ASF contribution. PawWork's repository-level `NOTICE` also describes unrelated OpenCode material, but that notice does not pertain to this contributor-confirmed slice. No PawWork or OpenCode bytes outside the two stated batches are part of this port.

The exact Maka introduction boundary is the following 23-file change. This list records the transfer boundary, not an assertion that every byte in each integration file came from PawWork:

- `apps/desktop/src/global.d.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/automation-host.test.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/browser-logic.test.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/browser-session.test.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/browser-tools.test.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/browser-view-manager.test.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/cdp-bridge.test.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/browser/automation-host.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/browser/browser-host.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/browser/browser-tools.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/browser/cdp-bridge.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/browser/controller.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/browser/logic.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/browser/options.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/browser/session.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/browser/view-manager.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/main.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/preload/preload.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/browser-panel.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css`
- `packages/core/src/browser.ts`
- `packages/core/src/index.ts`

Subsequent refactors moved `apps/desktop/src/renderer/browser-panel.tsx` to `apps/desktop/src/renderer/features/workbar/tools/browser/browser-panel.tsx` and deleted the old `packages/core/src/index.ts` barrel. Those changes do not add another source batch; the introduction commit and fixed upstream revisions remain the provenance anchors.

### Bundled Skills

Pull request #2695 removed the 29 bundled Skills whose individual origins could not be confirmed. The one retained bundled Skill, `computer-use`, carries its origin and review evidence here rather than in `SKILL.md` so that provenance edits do not change installed Skill content hashes.

- **Status:** contributor-confirmed, `origin: independently-authored`, Apache-2.0.
- **Author:** Haoqing Wang (@hqhq1025), with drafting and implementation assistance from OpenAI Codex.
- **Inputs:** Maka Computer Use source code, the `maka.cu/2` schema and model-facing tool contract, and Maka Computer Use tests. No third-party Skill bodies were used.
- **Introduced by:** pull request #2147, commit `2fb83e20b71124bc4a4f2fd4e40f971e415d0ea5`; contributor confirmed on 2026-08-11.
- **Review:** independently reviewed by Astro-Han in pull request #2676 at commit `3c7683b9793e97cba7d8536f6864da0e38f24c30` on 2026-08-12. That review covers the accuracy of this origin record; it does not make a legal or ASF release determination about implementation inputs (see [Computer Use implementation inputs](#computer-use-implementation-inputs)).

### Computer Use implementation inputs

Pull requests #1255 and #1883 and the contributor's confirmation on pull request #2676 state that a fixed signed `SkyComputerUseService` binary was statically inspected and that specific cursor geometry, motion values, thresholds, path-measurement choices, and core scoring weights were recovered and retained. The repository contains neither OpenAI source nor executable bytes. This is a narrow statement about the listed facts, not a classification of the Computer Use implementation as a whole as binary-derived.

The exact boundary, locally authored divergences, and artifact reproducibility limit are recorded in `docs/computer-use-cursor-provenance.md`. Whether the applicable agreement and law permit retaining those listed facts remains a human legal/ASF question. The provenance review does not answer it.

### Generated images

A maintainer confirmed that the following assets were AI-generated and that no third-party image, logo, or artwork was uploaded as input:

- `.github/assets/maka-hero.en.png`
- `.github/assets/maka-hero.zh-CN.png`
- `apps/desktop/assets/icon.png`
- `apps/desktop/resources/status/cu-status.png`
- `apps/desktop/resources/status/cu-status@2x.png`

The first three used ChatGPT Image. The status PNGs were exported from an AI-generated SVG. Exact prompts were not retained and may have requested a visual style reference, so this confirmation is provenance evidence rather than a guarantee that no style or IP concern exists.

### Source archive non-text inventory

The ASF source verifier reads this inventory from the candidate itself. A
non-text image must match one of these paths; executable and archive magic is
rejected even if a path is listed here.

- `.github/assets/*.png`: the AI-generated hero images recorded above.
- `apps/desktop/assets/icon.png`: the AI-generated application mark recorded above.
- `apps/desktop/assets/app-icons/*.png`: `mono.png` is the contributor-submitted grayscale derivative of the application mark from pull request #3431; the remaining variants are reproducibly rendered from the Apache-licensed geometry and palette in `scripts/generate-app-icons.py` and byte-checked by `scripts/generate-app-icons.test.mjs`.
- `apps/desktop/build/*.png`: contributor-submitted DMG artwork from pull request #3817; that contribution records Codex as review and verification assistance, not as the source of the artwork.
- `apps/desktop/resources/status/*.png`: the status images recorded above and reproducibly rendered by `scripts/generate-cu-status-icons.mjs`.
- `docs/images/**/*.png`: screenshots of Maka's own user interface committed as review evidence, including pull requests #3584 and #3588.
- `packages/core/src/__tests__/foreign-session.test.ts`: Apache-licensed source fixture containing a literal NUL, bidi override, and zero-width character to verify imported-session sanitization.
- `packages/runtime-host/src/protocol/artifact.ts`: Apache-licensed protocol source containing literal C0 and DEL characters in the control-character rejection expression.
- `packages/storage/src/__tests__/foreign-session-store.test.ts`: Apache-licensed storage fixture containing literal bidi and bell characters to verify durable imported-title sanitization.
- `packages/storage/src/__tests__/mcp-config-store.test.ts`: Apache-licensed validation fixture containing a literal control character in a rejected MCP tool name.
- `packages/storage/test-fixtures/v0.1.6-operational-state/runtime.sqlite`: migration fixture created through Maka's public storage APIs at tag `v0.1.6`; its exact origin and SHA-256 are recorded in the adjacent `README.md`.

## Bootstrap generative tooling

The initial commit is `8fd91a43cc64cdde58cfbd046256effce0cfa6f8` (2026-05-19). The current contributor account is expected to confirm the bootstrap history. The working account is that Raft orchestrated Claude and Codex, but the repository does not establish:

- the exact Raft product or version;
- the exact Claude and Codex products or model versions;
- whether each tool was used through an individual, team, enterprise, API, or other agreement;
- the governing terms and dates for those accounts;
- whether any training-data similarity or provenance protection was enabled.

Until the contributor supplies that information, this item is `pending contributor confirmation`. It does not block publication of this evidence report, but it prevents the stronger conclusion that every bootstrap tool's applicable terms have been verified against ASF generative-tooling guidance.

## Policy boundary and remaining actions

ASF guidance permits AI-assisted contributions when the tool terms do not restrict output incompatibly with open source and any included third-party material is absent or used under a compatible license. Code scanning can provide reasonable evidence, but the ASF does not prescribe SCANOSS or FOSSA and a scanner result is not an originality certificate.

Before code transfer or release review:

1. obtain and record the bootstrap contributor confirmation;
2. obtain an appropriate human legal/ASF determination about retaining the specifically documented facts recovered through static inspection, or replace those facts and dependent code independently;
3. have the human contributor of record review this report, the 25 classifications, and the final `LICENSE`/`NOTICE` decision;

No additional source-removal issue is indicated by the recovered scan. A recurring cloud snippet scan is not recommended until the project chooses a service, data policy, stable thresholds, and an owner for false-positive review. The local dependency-notice check remains the narrower, deterministic CI control for shipped npm dependencies.

That check has a structural blind spot worth stating plainly. `scripts/generate-third-party-notices.mjs` derives its inventory from npm production dependency trees, so material that enters the repository as vendored or adapted source, or as generated data, is invisible to it by construction — not missed by accident. The opencode adaptations and models.dev snapshot are now registered explicitly in the root `LICENSE`; every future source of this kind must likewise be registered by hand unless the generator gains a checked manual inventory.

The scanner has a comparable blind spot. Entry 17 was matched at 14% against an unrelated package, and what actually identified its origin was structural: near-verbatim doc comments, preserved declaration forms, and a reproduced upstream inconsistency. A follow-up sweep for the same pattern across the repository — comparing locally declared types against installed dependency declarations by name overlap and ordered property sequences — found no second instance. That sweep is still blind to a copy whose type and field names were renamed, and no comment, import, or architectural note suggests such a case exists.

## AI assistance disclosure

OpenAI Codex reconstructed the scan evidence, compared the fixed source snapshot with the recovered scanner output, and drafted this report and the accompanying attribution changes. The human contributor of record must review and own the classifications, accuracy, provenance, licensing, and submission decision.
