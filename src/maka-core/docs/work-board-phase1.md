# Work Board Phase 1 — capture/list MVP

## Surface

A compact Work Board tab in the session workbar, next to Tasks, with:

- global Inbox and current-project filtering;
- manual create, rename, move (Inbox <-> project), complete / reopen,
  archive / restore, and delete (archived items only);
- empty, loading, and error states;
- local-first persistence through the existing operational-state database.

## Boundary

- The Desktop main process owns `WorkBoardStore`; the renderer is a read-only
  IPC projection that reloads on the `workBoard:changed` signal.
- No Runtime Host involvement, model-visible tools, or automatic prompt injection.
- `linkedSessions` and the linked-session projection remain deferred to Phase 3.

## Why a dedicated store instead of a project file

A project `TODO.md` / issue would cover the literal capture-and-list atom, but
the one thing that justifies a store is **provenance + Session linking**:
side-conversation captures must keep typed source references and a bounded
excerpt after the temporary fork is deleted, and Phase 3 must link a board item
to the Session it starts. Typed provenance and stable item identity also let
concurrent Desktop writers mutate items with revision CAS instead of parsing a
file. If provenance and Session linking were not in scope, a project file would
suffice.

## Assumption

We are betting that users will return to the board and start tasks from it.
Phase 3 must prove this.

## Sequencing

Per maintainer review, the thin capture -> revisit -> start-as-task loop is
validated **before** Phase 2 (side-chat capture) and Phase 4 (evidence /
refinement): a minimal, flag-gated Phase 3 spike wires one hard-coded item ->
"Start task" -> new Session -> link back, with no polish. Only if the loop
shows real use do we resume Phases 2 and 4.

## Implementation

- Main: `apps/desktop/src/main/work-board-ipc-main.ts`
  (`workBoard:list/create/update/archive/unarchive/remove` + change signal).
- Preload: `window.maka.workBoard` in `apps/desktop/src/preload/preload.ts`.
- Renderer: `useWorkBoard` hook and `WorkBoardPanel`, wired as a workbar tab in
  `session-workbar.tsx`.
