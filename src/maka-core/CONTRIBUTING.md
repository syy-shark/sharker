# Contributing to Maka

[![docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-%E7%AE%80%E4%BD%93%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87-blue?logo=googletranslate&logoColor=white)](./CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md)

## Where to start

Bug fixes, model provider support, tests, performance work, and documentation merge most readily. Pick something up from [`help wanted`](https://github.com/apache/maka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) · [`good first issue`](https://github.com/apache/maka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) · [`bug`](https://github.com/apache/maka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) · [`enhancement`](https://github.com/apache/maka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) and claim it in a comment. Use the **Bug report** or **Feature request** template for new issues; report security problems through [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md), never as a public issue. Questions, ideas, and not-yet-actionable proposals belong in [Discussions](https://github.com/apache/maka/discussions), which reaches the whole team by email.

To self-assign an unclaimed issue, post a comment whose entire body is exactly `take`; post `untake` to remove your assignment. Other claim text does not trigger the workflow.

Project direction, governance, and material product decisions are discussed publicly on [`dev@maka.apache.org`](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@maka.apache.org) before implementation; implementation-level decisions may live in the pull request.

## Human ownership and AI attribution

Every contribution has a human contributor of record who reviews the work, decides to submit it, and owns its accuracy, provenance, and licensing. Agents may commit and push freely; the final review and merge decision always belongs to a human.

Each pull request states whether generative tooling contributed substantively, naming the tool if so; translation, wording edits, autocomplete, and spelling correction don't count. Automated messages must identify themselves. When AI authors a material part of a contribution, add a `Generated-by: <tool>` trailer to each affected commit, and keep it in the final commit through squash or amend.

## Review

Every pull request to `main` needs an approving review from a committer other than the author and a passing `test` check; branch protection in [`.asf.yaml`](./.asf.yaml) enforces both. An approval stays valid across later pushes — push follow-up commits in the open, and ask for another look when the change grows past what was reviewed. The review must be an independent human judgment — AI review does not count. A maintainer decides whether a change is material and whether the review it received is enough.

## Provenance and licensing

Submit only work you have the right to contribute, and record third-party sources, licenses, and attribution. Contributions are licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE); for material AI-generated content, follow the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html).

## Quick start

Requires Node `>=22.19.0` and npm `11.19.0` (root `package.json`). Direct Peer or Peer Mesh Desktop development additionally needs Rust stable 1.98 or newer and Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS, or MSVC Build Tools on Windows.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apache/maka.git
cd maka
npm install                 # root only — never inside a workspace
npm run build               # builds every workspace in dependency order
npm --workspace @maka/core test
```

## Developing Maka

```sh
npm run dev          # desktop app with HMR
npm run cli:dev      # TUI; `npm run cli:dev -- run "…"` runs one non-interactive turn
npm test             # all workspaces, or: npm --workspace @maka/core test
```

Building a single workspace only succeeds when its dependencies are already built — when unsure, build from the root. Tests run against compiled output in `dist/`; each workspace's `test` script cleans, builds, then runs `node --test`. Always go through it.

Before pushing, match CI locally:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npx knip --workspace apps/desktop
npx knip --workspace packages/ui
```

Architecture is documented in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md); evaluation commands and contracts live in [`packages/eval`](./packages/eval).

## Pull requests

Opening a pull request pre-fills [`pull_request_template.md`](./.github/pull_request_template.md); fill it in rather than replacing it.

Branches and titles follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): branches are `<type>/<description>`, titles are `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`. The repository squash-merges, so the title becomes the commit on `main`; `git log` shows the types and scopes in use.

For UI changes, include before/after screenshots or a recording. Keep the description short and your own — if it needs many paragraphs, the pull request is probably too large.
