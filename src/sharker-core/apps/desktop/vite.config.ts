/**
 * PR-ICONS-FULL-REPLACE-0 (WAWQAQ msg `60064e2d` 2026-06-24): point the
 * renderer at `@sharker/ui` SOURCE, not its prebuilt dist. Before this,
 * Node resolution sent `@sharker/ui` to `packages/ui/dist/index.js`; if
 * that dist was stale (built before an icon-library swap), the home
 * page would still render the old icon set even though source had
 * migrated. Aliasing to src makes the renderer source-of-truth single
 * — no more "rebuilt source but UI still old" foot-gun.
