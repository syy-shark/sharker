/**
 * macOS development app for OS-permission work.
 *
 * macOS TCC will not keep an Accessibility or Screen Recording grant for an
 * unsigned executable launched from a terminal. It needs a stable bundle
 * identity, a verifiable signature, and a responsible process that is the app
 * bundle itself. That is what this module builds: an ad-hoc-signed
 * `Sharker Dev.app` launched through LaunchServices.
 *
 * The bundle is a copy of the npm Electron app with its identity rewritten and
 * a small bootstrap injected. Everything the bootstrap needs is a build-time
 * constant, so a launch with no arguments and no environment — the Dock,
 * Spotlight, or the system's Screen Recording "Quit & Reopen" — reproduces a
 * correct app. The launcher's one-shot result file reports only the Electron
 * lock verdict; it does not supervise the app or carry application state. The
 * app instance and the dev session remain separate lifecycles: stopping the
 * launcher never terminates the TCC app.
 *
 * `app.isPackaged` is native and computed as
 * `basename(process.execPath) !== 'electron'`, so the invariant that keeps
 * every dev-mode gate alive is simply that the inner executable stays named
 * `Electron` — NOT the payload's location. (It is not derived from
 * `process.defaultApp`; that flag is set by the stock default_app this module
 * replaces, and is therefore undefined here.)
 *
 * The payload occupies `default_app.asar` rather than `Resources/app` so it
 * cannot shadow a real packaged app laid down at the standard location.
