// What the metering proxy observed, and nothing that can be worked out from it.

// These counts cross a process boundary twice: the wrapper reports them in its
// result frame, and writes them to a checkpoint the host reads when the wrapper
// was killed before it could report. Anything derivable — settled requests,
// missing usage, whether the figure is complete, what it cost — is computed by
// `deriveMetering` on whichever side needs it, so the two sides cannot hold two
// versions of a value neither of them owns.
//
// `inFlightRequests` is the only field that separates the two readers: it is
// zero by construction once the proxy has settled, and may be positive in a
// checkpoint written mid-request.

// keep a provider that reports cache writes separately from being billed at
