// PR-RUNTIME-CU — the model-facing `computer` tool + its dispatch seam.
//
// This is platform-agnostic: the actual host input/capture is done by an
// injected `CuDispatchBackend` (the desktop app spawns the signed Swift helper
// and implements this interface). The tool owns the Path 18 obligations that
// are OS-independent: per-action TCC re-check (S12), coordinate authority stays
// runtime-side (S15), a closed typed-error surface (S17), and AbortSignal
// threading (S18). The backend owns the actual AX/capture dispatch.

 * that way. Its fields were added to the union, its tests passed against the
 * union, and a real-machine probe called the backend directly and moved a
 * window. This schema is `.strict()` and had no `window_action`, `position` or
 * `size` in it, so every call a model made was rejected by the SDK before
 * reaching the tool — invisible to the debug journal, which wraps `impl`. The
 * action was unusable from the day it was added and nothing said so.

 * Says so when an argument holds a placeholder from the model's own call

 *
 * The record the model reads back withholds screen-derived and typed values and
 * leaves a shape in their place. Those shapes are legal strings: `value` and
 * `text` are `z.string().max(8000)` with no lower bound and no pattern, so
 * `"<text:18>"` passes the wire schema and the strict union both, and a model
 * replaying its own `set_value` would type those characters into the user's
 * field. Nothing here reads the argument's contents beyond matching that shape.
 *
 * Every string argument, not the three that were named. The named list was
 * written when `value`, `text` and `steps[].value` were the only arguments a
 * shape could reach; `observe`'s `query` and `menu` and `wait`'s
 * `wait_for_text` are plain strings the schema accepts too, and a placeholder
 * there is the quieter failure of the two — a model that filtered a window with
 * `query:"下载"`, replayed `query:"<text:2>"` and read `showing 0 of 1200` had
 * been told the control does not exist. Those arguments no longer come back as
 * shapes, and this is what makes that a property of the tool rather than of one
 * map staying in step with another.
