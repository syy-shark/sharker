 * views of one number: composition is measured in **bytes of serialized
 * request**, sums to `requestBytes`, and never sums to the reported
 * `inputTokens`. Nothing here estimates tokens — a byte count is the fact this
 * layer holds, and turning it into a token figure is a display decision that
 * has to be labelled as an estimate where it is made (#1679).
 *
 * `tool_schema` folds per tool rather than into one total, because that is the
 * only breakdown a reader can act on: "tool definitions are 40%" names nothing
 * to remove. Every other kind folds whole — one system prompt, one history, one
 * options blob — and splitting `message` by what produced it is not knowable
 * here, where messages arrive already serialized.
