/**
 * Shared main-session prompt assembly (#2352).
 *
 * Main-session system prompts used to be built only from functional fragments
 * (personalization, skills, AGENTS.md, memory, …) and never opened with a
 * product identity. This closes that gap while leaving sub-agent identities to
 * the agent catalog.
 *
 * The assembler is deliberately order-agnostic: it only prepends the shared
 * defaults, drops empty fragments, and joins. It does NOT impose a fixed
 * fragment order, because several fragments are position-semantic and must stay
 * where the host put them — e.g. the Side Chat isolation boundary and the Deep
 * Research mode contract are trailing assertions that constrain everything
 * before them, so moving them earlier weakens them. Each host keeps its existing
 * fragment order.
 *
 * The identity and response-format guidance are pure static text: constant
 * across turns, so they never churn the systemPromptHash / prefix-cache (see
 * request-shape.ts). They are intentionally NOT injected into sub-agent
 * (childInstruction) paths, which already carry their own role identities.

Use GitHub-Flavored Markdown for responses.
Keep simple answers simple; do not add headings or lists to simple answers.
Use short headings and flat lists to organize longer answers.
Use fenced code blocks for multiline code and backticks for inline commands, paths, identifiers, and literal values.
Prefer descriptive link text for external sources when it is available.
Follow a more specific format requested by the user or task.`;
