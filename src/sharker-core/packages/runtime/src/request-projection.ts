/**
 * Deterministic request-projection pipeline over ONE provider-visible request.
 * Order is a contract: mid-turn capacity compaction runs first among the
 * message-shaping hooks so every later mechanism operates on its projection —
 * active tool-result pruning re-archives large tool results in the rebuilt
 * tail.
 *
 * Every hook here only SHAPES the projection. The pass/terminate capacity
 * verdict is issued once, after the whole pipeline, by the final-request
 * estimate owner (buildMidTurnFinalRequestVerdict) over the actual outgoing
 * (messages, tools) payload — never by an individual hook over an intermediate
 * projection that a later hook could still rescue.
