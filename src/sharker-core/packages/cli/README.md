# Apache Sharker (Incubating) CLI

[简体中文](https://github.com/apache/sharker/blob/main/packages/cli/README.zh-CN.md)

Sharker is a local-first agent workspace. The `sharker-agent` npm package installs the interactive
terminal UI, the non-interactive CLI, Runtime Host tooling, and the Eval command.

## Apache Incubation Disclaimer

Apache Sharker is undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation. The published npm README
includes the canonical work-in-progress disclaimer below directly from the release commit's
[DISCLAIMER-WIP](https://github.com/apache/sharker/blob/main/DISCLAIMER-WIP); the
[Sharker podling status page](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/sharker.html) records current status.

<!-- ASF-WIP-DISCLAIMER -->

> **Beta:** The CLI is under active development. Commands and local data formats may change before
> the stable release.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.19.0 or newer;
- a terminal with interactive input for the TUI;
- a configured model connection for agent turns; first-run setup currently supports API-key
  providers.

The release gate validates the following installed-package matrix:

| Platform | Architecture | Node.js | TUI, CLI, Runtime Host | Real Harbor/Pier Eval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | x64 | 22.19 | Validated | Preflight only |
| Linux | x64 | 24 | Validated | Validated |
| Linux | arm64 | 24 | Validated | Preflight only |
| macOS | arm64 | 24 | Validated | Preflight only |
| Windows | x64 | 24 | Validated | Preflight only |

Other combinations that satisfy the Node.js minimum may work, but are not part of the current
release gate. Real Eval executor validation currently runs on Linux x64 with Node.js 24.

## Install

Install the current beta explicitly from the `next` dist-tag:

```sh
npm install --global sharker-agent@next
sharker --version
sharker --help
```

The public command is `sharker`. For a one-off invocation, use
`npx --yes --package sharker-agent@next sharker`; the unrelated `sharker` package on npm is not this project.
`runtime-host service install` uses the persistent global installation above; `runtime-host setup`
creates its own managed copy from the exact package invoked by `npx`.

## First run

Start Sharker from the project directory the agent should work in:

```sh
cd path/to/project
sharker
```

If no model connection exists, Sharker opens the provider setup flow. Select a provider, enter its API
key, choose the enabled models, and save. Run `/setup` later to add or update a provider and `/model`
to switch models.

API keys and workspace state stay in the local `Sharker` profile. The current credential vault is a
local plaintext file protected by the operating-system account boundary; on POSIX systems Sharker
enforces owner-only directory and file modes. It is not an OS keychain. See the repository
[security policy](https://github.com/apache/sharker/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for the current
boundary.

Run one non-interactive turn with:

```sh
sharker run "Summarize this project and identify its highest-risk area"
sharker run --help
```

Sharker asks before privileged tool operations by default. `sharker run --yolo` grants the task full file
and network access and should only be used in an environment you are prepared to let the task
modify.

## Upgrade

While using prereleases, keep the `next` tag explicit:

```sh
sharker update --target next
sharker --version
```

The update stages and verifies the exact release before replacing the local Runtime Host or the
npm-global package. It refuses to interrupt active or durable work by default. Use
`--allow-interrupt-active-tasks` only after deciding that interruption is safe. A direct
`npm install --global sharker-agent@next` remains available for installation repair; do not use a bare
`npm update --global sharker-agent`, because it follows `latest` and may select a different release
line. After a stable release is available, select it with `sharker update --target latest`.

## Remote Runtime Host setup

To set up a persistent remote Runtime Host from an exact released package on Linux or macOS:

```sh
npx --yes --package sharker-agent@next sharker runtime-host setup \
  --principal my-client \
  --preset terminal-client
```

Rerunning setup replaces that Client credential. The service no longer depends on the temporary
`npx` cache after setup succeeds.

Check a managed service against a release channel without changing the running Host:

```sh
sharker runtime-host service check-update --target next --json
```

The result pins the selected channel to an exact version and package integrity. It also reports
whether the package carries enough compatibility evidence for unattended use; this command never
installs or switches a package. Installation-management callers can pass the same selector to
`service update --target`. That path verifies the archive and extracted manifest before delegating
to the existing exact-package update transaction, and does not mutate a candidate that requires
manual review.

The installation owner can persist one update target and reconcile it with the same verified
transaction:

```sh
sharker runtime-host service update-policy --target latest \
  --expected-service-id <service-id> \
  --expected-root-path <state-root> \
  --expected-root-id <root-id>
sharker runtime-host service reconcile-update --json
```

Use `update-policy --target manual` to disable automatic reconciliation. Reconciliation is a
bounded one-shot command: it never interrupts active work and does not install a scheduler.

## Uninstall

```sh
# When a managed Runtime Host service was installed on Linux or macOS
npx --yes --package sharker-agent@next sharker runtime-host service uninstall

# If Sharker was installed globally
npm uninstall --global sharker-agent
```

Remove the managed service before removing a global package so the OS service manager does not
retain a service pointing to the deleted CLI. Neither command deletes model connections,
credentials, sessions, or artifacts.
Those remain in the profile shared by the released CLI and Desktop app:

| Platform | Profile directory |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Sharker` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Sharker`, or `~/.config/Sharker` when unset |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Sharker` |

Back up and remove that directory separately only when you intend to delete all local Sharker data.
Close the CLI and Desktop app first.

## Eval

Run a declarative experiment with:

```sh
sharker eval run experiment.json --out .sharker-eval/run-001
```

The npm package includes Sharker's Eval runtime, relay, wrapper, and container policy assets. It does
not install the executor's external software or machine-local benchmark data. Before starting any
trial, Eval checks the exact prerequisites declared by the spec and fails without running a cell if
one is missing.

For Docker-based Harbor or Pier specs, provide:

- a reachable Docker CLI and daemon;
- a dedicated Python environment containing the exact framework version declared by
  `executor.config.frameworkVersion`;
- an executable interpreter through the environment variable named by `pythonPathEnv`;
- writable trial storage through `trialsRootEnv`;
- for Pier, the task directory named by `tasksRootEnv`;
- every machine path and subject credential environment variable declared by the spec.

Harbor and Pier must use separate Python environments. The currently validated versions are:

```sh
python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/sharker-harbor-0.20.0
~/.venvs/sharker-harbor-0.20.0/bin/python -m pip install 'harbor==0.20.0'

python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/sharker-pier-0.3.0
~/.venvs/sharker-pier-0.3.0/bin/python -m pip install 'datacurve-pier==0.3.0'
```

Set the spec's `pythonPathEnv` to the corresponding `bin/python` path. Do not reuse one environment
for both frameworks: their dependency and trial contracts differ. Advanced experiment and
toolchain details live in the
[Eval documentation](https://github.com/apache/sharker/tree/main/packages/eval).

## Troubleshooting

Start by recording the installed versions:

```sh
node --version
npm --version
sharker --version
```

- If `sharker` is not found after a global install, ensure npm's global executable directory is on
  `PATH`.
- If no model is available, start the TUI and run `/setup`.
- If Eval refuses to start, follow the reported environment-variable name and expected framework
  version; it does not install or silently substitute missing prerequisites.
- When reporting a problem, include the three versions above, the operating system and
  architecture, the command, and the complete error with credentials removed.
