/**
 * Centralized icon re-export — the single seam between Sharker call sites
 * and the underlying generic UI icon library.
 *
 * Business code imports icons from `@sharker/ui/icons`; this file decides
 * which icon set backs those names. Generic UI icons now come directly
 * from `lucide-react`. Bot/channel brand logos live in
 * `bot-brand-logo.tsx` because they are fixed product assets, not generic
 * UI icons.

/**
 * The five-rung icon scale. Pick by the role the glyph plays, not by eye.
 *
 * A size has to be passed at every lucide call site: Astryx's `sm` button
 * bounds the icon slot at 16px (Button.tsx's `iconSizeStyles`) but does not
 * resize the glyph inside it, so an unsized lucide icon keeps its own 24px
 * height and renders 16×24, squashed. `chrome` (16) exactly fills that slot;
 * the other rungs sit around it. Mirrored as `--icon-*` in sharker-tokens.css
 * for the CSS-clamped sites.
