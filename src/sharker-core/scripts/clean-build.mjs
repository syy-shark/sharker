/**
 * PR-BUILD-HYGIENE-0: remove every workspace's `dist` and incremental
 * tsbuildinfo so the next `npm run build` is forced to recompile from
 * source. Solves the recurring "tests pass on stale dist" foot-gun
 * that kept biting us during Phase 3 P0 fixups — every time we
 * removed/renamed an export, the old dist would survive and tests
 * would lie.
 *
 * Workspace list is derived from root package.json so it cannot drift
 * from npm workspaces (e.g. packages/computer-use). Desktop keeps a
 * few extra outputs (renderer bundle + multi-tsconfig build info).
 *
 * Idempotent; missing paths are silently ignored.
 *
 * Run via `npm run clean` at the repo root.
